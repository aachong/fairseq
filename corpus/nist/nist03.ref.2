daschle urges president bush to provide hard evidence to show hussein violating rules
( afp report from washington d.c. , january 28 ) senate democrats ' leader daschle expressed his objection to president bush 's evidence to show that iraq owns weapons of mass destruction , suspecting that the white house had a set of " guiding principles " to justify its attack on hussein .
daschle asked : " if we 've got evidence that iraq has nuclear and biological weapons , why not show it to the world ? just like 40 years ago when president kennedy had photos showing cuba had missiles and ordered the ambassador to the un stevenson to show them at the un assembly . "
daschle harshly attacked president bush in a speech to the national journalist club in washington when un arms inspectors presented their reports to the un security council on whether or not iraq had abided by the disarmament requirements .
" when we begin to launch a war against terrorism , people in the united states have the right to know why thousands of us troops will be sent to the battlefields to risk their lives . the united states will spend billions of dollars while at the cost of offending the alliance to enrage the opponents to attack iraq , " he said .
" in a democratic country , the president should do his best to clear up people 's doubts and this is very important , " said daschle .
he referred to the american people 's declining support for president bush in a public opinion poll .
the white house , in turn , justifies the urgency to overthrow hussein with various kinds of excuses , including threats to neighbors , persecution of the kurds , attempting to kill president bush , linking to the 9.11 attacks , making weapons of mass destruction , which confuse people who don 't know which one they should believe .
" it makes people to suspect that the government has already had the supreme guiding principles , " he said .

even taking this reason into consideration , the queue applying for unemployment relief fund still kept getting longer last month .
the seasonally adjusted data released by germany 's frankfurt central bank shows that january 's total unemployed population shot up to 4.274 million from last december 's 4.212 .

life will inevitably be messed up when you are earning millions of dollars and replacing jordan to become basketball 's major promoter .
yao ming said : " everything happens so fast , too fast .
you never expect to own everything from the very beginning . you expect to take a while to be part of nba but things have been different .
however , not everything is up to you to decide . "

research finds father 's gene may affect timing of child 's birth
( afp report from paris , february 28 ) according to a denmark research report published on saturday 's british medical weekly , father 's gene may affect the timing of a child 's birth .
about 5 % pregnant women may have prolonged pregnancy , or to say the pregnancy reaches 294 days .
it is now known that the problem will have negative effects on the health of the pregnant women and their children . however , what is the real reason is still unknown .
researchers in denmark followed 43,000 birth cases from 1980 to 1992 . all the surveyed pregnant women had at least two children and had prolonged pregnancy when they gave the first birth .
analysis were only based on their previous two-birth information .
in general , among the women who had prolonged pregnancy when giving first birth , nearly 20 % had the same experience when they were pregnant for the second time .
however , when the first and second child 's father was not the same person , the rate declined to slightly over 15 % .
major writher of the research report ellison told afp : " this is already very high .
this shows that if you have the same partner ( when giving birth to the second child ) then the possibility for you to have a longer pregnancy is 30 % higher than those who have changed their partners . "
the research report says : " if women change their partners for pregnancy , they can reduce the danger of repeated prolonged pregnancy .
we think that this is a new discovery .
and this means that the timing of the birth may be decided by the father 's gene . "

( by staff reporter wang zhenhua ) - a report issued by the us state of commerce shows although us consumer spending saw a rapid growth last december , the whole year 's growth remained the same to that of 2001 when the economy went into recession .

spending on durable consumer goods grew by 6.1 % while spending on non-durable consumer goods and services grew by only 0.2 % .

consumer spending , which accounts for 2 / 3 of us gdp , saw a rise of 1 % last quarter , obviously lower than the growth of 4.2 % in the third quarter , the lowest gain since the first quarter of 1993 .

last year , us consumer spending rose by 4.5 % , the same as that of 2001 .
the report also shows that americans ' incomes rose by 0.4 % last december .
americans ' incomes grew by 3 % last year , lower than the 3.3 % in 2001 .
as consumer spending growth was higher than that of incomes , us savings rate decreased from 4.5 % in december to 4.1 % at the end of last year .
