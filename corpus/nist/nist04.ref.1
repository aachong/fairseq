Koizumi Vows to Continue Promoting Economic Reform This Year
( AFP report from Tokyo , January 5 ) Speaking at the press conference held on the first working day following the New Year 's holiday , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi vowed to continue to push forward the economic reform this year . He said : " Although the economic situation is still difficult , we will eventually see signs of recovery . "

US Begins Photographing and Fingerprinting of Foreign Tourists
( AFP report from Washington D.C. , January 5 ) The United States today began to take new steps of photographing and fingerprinting of foreign tourists who entered the US as Singapore , which has the largest airport in Asia , showed support to adding more guards on board airplanes to deal with the threats of terrorism .
Washington authorities strengthened inspections of foreign tourists when worries about flight security were sharply increasing recently . Over the past week , such worries have led to the temporary cancellation of several flights from and to the United States .
The new measures of photographing and fingerprinting will only apply to foreign visitors who need entry visas , the number of whom is expected to reach 23 million this year .
The Homeland Security Department , which is responsible in implementing the US Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology ( US-VISIT ) plan , pointed out that citizens from most of Europe 's 28 countries were free from these procedures .
Immigration groups have accused the plan of infringing citizens ' freedom rights and it was a step towards a society under surveillance . Secretary of the Homeland Security Department , Ridge , has strongly defended the plan .
Speaking in an interview by the National Broadcasting Corporation ( NBC ) , Ridge said : " The priority of any government is to safeguard the border security . We are carrying out the plan to fulfill our responsibility . I don 't think it is a rash plan . In fact , it takes only about 15 seconds and obviously nobody cares about that . "
By 2005 , photographing and fingerprinting techniques will be adopted in all entry ports via land , sea and air .
All the US visas and passports will eventually carry " biological identification marks " including photos and fingerprints .
Before the implementation of the plan , the United States raised its anti-terrorist attack alert in December last year .
Six-Way Talks Likely to Be Postponed to Mid-Year Due to US and North Korea 's Hard Stands
( AFP report from Seoul , January 6 ) South Korea said today that due to the hard stands of the United States and North Korea , a new round of six-way nuclear meeting was likely to be postponed to the middle of the year .
Speaking on his way to Chong Wa Dae for a cabinet meeting , South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan told reporters : " I hope the meeting will be held at least in the first half of this year . "
Yoon Young-Kwan made the remarks after Washington refused Pyongyang 's latest proposal of making big concessions for freezing the nuclear project and said the two sides still needed to settle serious differences before the nuclear meeting .
Yoon Young-Kwan said that the timetable for the six participating countries had in fact ruled out the possibility of resuming the six-way talks in January .
However , he did not further explain why the new round of meeting might be postponed to June or later .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov has attributed this to the hard stands of the United States and North Korea .
He attended the first round of six-way talks held in Beijing in August last year .
After meeting with senior Chinese officials yesterday , Losyukov told the Inter-Fax Agency : " The reason remains the same as in the past . The two sides lacked mutual trust and their demands were too harsh . "
Yoon Young-Kwan raised the possibility of the postponement of the talks after North Korea had once again asked the United States to promise concessions before the new round of six-way talks .
Washington has accused Pyongyang of setting prerequisites for the new round of six-way talks .
The United States is seeking a North Korea promise to give up its nuclear weapon project .
North Korea said that if Washington lifted its economic sanctions against Pyongyang and resumed the energy assistance , it would freeze the nuclear facilities .
In the past , North Korea also firmly required a non-aggression treaty with the United States .

( AFP report from Monrovia , January 12 ) After the expulsion of Conneh , leader of " Liberians United Reconciliation and Democracy ( LURD ) " , the struggles for the command of Liberia 's largest rebel group have intensified . One rebel leader has firmly claimed that Conneh was still in power .
LURD rose up against former president Taylor 's government in 1999 , sparking a four-year civil war in Liberia , and gaining control of some 4 / 5 of Liberia 's territory .
In mid-August last year , Taylor agreed to go to Nigeria in exile , paving the way for the western African country to reach a reconciliation and power-sharing agreement . The former government and the rebels as well as the opposition parties formed a transitional government .
However , a LURD clique that calls itself " top military command " has accused Conneh of selling posts in the transitional governments for his own profits and announced recently that they supported Conneh 's ex-wife , Aisha Keita Conneh , to replace Conneh as the new leader .
But Dweh , the current transitional parliament speaker and founder of LURD , firmly insisted that LURD 's National Executive Committee had the sole power to sack the group 's leaders .
He told the media the night before yesterday : " I founded LURD in Nigeria and I can ensure the Liberian people that there is no split in LURD and nothing can impair the peace process . "
Dweh has attributed LURD 's rift to the behind-the-scene maneuvers by the transitional government leader Bryant and other senior leaders in the transitional government .
Businessman Bryant was named to lead the war-torn country to a general election in 2005 .
Dweh has accused the Justice Minister , Transportation Minister and Labor Minister of collaborating with Aisha Conneh under the support of Bryant and had promised her that once Conneh stepped down , she would lead LURD .
He warned that if Bryant continued to infringe the peace agreement , the conflicting parties would return to Accra where the agreement was drafted to discuss if they should replace Bryant .
Former American Boxer Accuses Boxing Promotion Company of Bribing for Cheating
The New York Daily News reported that former American boxer Rose said that staff members from the American professional boxing promotion company , Top Rank , had offered him 5,000 US dollars for cheating .
Top Rank , which is run by Arum , is now being investigated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation .
34-year-old Rose said that two Top Rank staff members went to his home several weeks before the fight with his fellow man " Butterbean " Esch in December 1995 .
Rose told the newspaper : " Shortly after the noon , I was taking a rest at home when somebody knocked at the door . I saw Top Rank 's two white staff members through the peephole . They wanted to talk with me about the fight with Butterbean . "
" They said : We 've got some money for you . It 's not small money . They wanted me not to beat Butterbean . "
Rose has reported it to the investigation agents . The case is part of the a 20-month investigation of corruption in American boxing circles .
Rose refused the bribe and knocked out Esch , who had not been defeated before , in the second round at Madison Square Garden .
The New York Daily News went to Esch 's home in Alabama to ask him if he believed what Rose said . Esch defended Top Rank , saying : " Rose is not strong . How can you ask a boxer , with six defeats and one win , to cheat ? I don 't think Top Rank would do something illegal . "
The FBI inspected Top Rank headquarters in Las Vegas , seizing financial and medical documents and computers .
Reports said that the FBI is collecting evidence of fight fixing , including the championship fight between Mosley and Hoya last September .

Bush Narrowly Saves Free Trade Zone Plan in American Summit
( AFP report from Monterrey , January 13 ) US President Bush 's ambitious plan to push forward the establishment of the American Free Trade Zone next year won narrow support from leaders of other 33 countries at today 's American Summit .
However , countries attending the summit differed in how the west hemisphere deals with the increasingly serious problem of poverty . The United States also failed to include an anti-graft article in the final communique .
The American Free Trade Zone covers areas from Alaska in the north to Argentina in the south , which is called the largest free trade zone in the world , with a market population of around 800 million and total GDP of 13 trillion US dollars .
However , Argentine President Kirchner made remarks to attack the US plan at the end of the two-day summit , saying the problems in America could not be solved only with the establishment of the free trade zone .
South America 's largest economy Brazil and major US oil supplier Venezuela both opposed the discussion of the American Free Trade Zone to be included in the agenda of the summit . But following intense discussions , all the leaders reached the agreement of completing the negotiations of the establishment of the American Free Trade Zone before January 2005 .

( AFP report from Tehran , January 13 ) The conflict between Iran 's reformists and the powerful conservatives over the issue of the former 's loss of the parliamentary election qualification intensified today as several cabinet ministers threatened a collective resignation unless the conservatives made concessions on the ban of reformists ' election qualification .
One of the vice presidents Satarifar warned that the entire government might resign unless actions were taken to prevent the attempts by the Constitution Supervision Committee to revoke the qualifications of thousands of candidates in the parliamentary election on February 20 .
Satarifar said : " If the government believes that it is unable to take the responsibility of protecting citizens ' rights and holding free elections , it will not choose to continue to stay in office . "
Governors of Iran 's 27 provinces have also threatened a collective resignation . Sources close to President Khatami disclosed that at least 10 ministers had prepared their resignation letters .
However , Khatami 's assistants have denied reports by some medias that moderate Khatami was ready to resign .
Angry reformist parliamentarians continued their third day of sit-down protest in the parliamentary building , claiming they would never balk at holding weeks of sit-down protest .
Eighty-three reformist parliamentarians have been deprived of qualifications for the re-election .
Iranian News Agency ( IRNA ) said that the parliamentarians had challenged the Constitution Supervision Committee , urging it to take back the ruling of the ban on election qualifications .
The Constitution Supervision Committee , consisting of 12 members , is not an elected political supervision institution and it is also a religious right-wing 's anti-reform stronghold .
Iran 's Nobel Peace Prize winner , Ebadi , who has long been hated by the hardliners , has also said that she would visit the Parliament to show her support to the reformists ' sit-down protest .
A Rising New Zealand Dollar Casting No Effect on Business Circle 's Confidence in New Zealand

Eleven percent of the exporters in the manufacturing and construction sectors have predicted a worse prospect in the coming half year while another 14 % of the non-exporters are optimistic about the business prospects in the coming half year .
The New Zealand dollar has risen by 30 % over the past two years .

( AFP report from Paris , January 17 ) Up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters held a demonstration in Paris to protest against the new generation of reactors , accusing the police of bringing about troubles by allowing another demonstration against a ban on religious headscarves in schools .
The anti-nuclear protesters ' main target was the European Pressurized Water Reactor ( EPWR ) , the first of which is to be built in Finland by a consortium including the French state-owned Areva group and German engineering giant Siemens at a cost of three billion euros ( 3.7 billion dollars ) .
As the world 's most nuclear-power-dependent country , France is expected to approve such reactors in the near future to begin the replacement of some of the 58 plants that produce 80 percent of the country 's electricity and are nearing the end of service .
Lhomme , spokesman of the End Nuclear Network , which was the organizer of the demonstration , said : " In fact , the actual nuclear recovery is appearing in front of us . "
Lhomme accused the police of allowing another rally and said : " We believe that the Interior Ministry is creating troubles . "
France 's Interior Ministry is in charge of the police in all cities .
The rally started at the same place in Paris and at almost the same time , attracting thousands of people to protest against the government ban on the Islamic headscarf and other " conspicuous " religious insignia in school .
According to the organizers , the number of anti-nuclear protesters topped 15,000 but the police 's estimate was fewer than 6,000 . They built a pyramid with tin cans in the square , denouncing what they called the " radioactive waste scandal left for future generations " .

Continuous Labor Decrease to Pound Economic Production in EU and Japan
( AFP report from Davos , Switzerland , January 19 ) A research report issued today by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) and US consultant Watson Wyatt Worldwide pointed out that European Union 's output volume would fall down by 50 % in the global economic output volume in 2050 due to the shrinkage of the labor population .
In contrast , the sufficient labor supply in developing countries such as India and China will help promote the economic development .
Executive President of Watson Wyatt Worldwide , Shamans , said : " Labor 's growth rate and the productive forces will decide the economic output .
In countries where there is a huge shortage of labor , the supply of goods and labor may not satisfy the demand and the living standards . "
The report titled " Live a Happier Life : An Impact on the Economy by An Aging Society " pointed out that thanks to the development in the healthcare sector , human beings have expanded their life span . Compared with the labor population , retired population is on a sustained rise ( especially in developed countries ) , which will definitely have direct impact on the economic production .
A statement in response to the research report pointed out that " EU 's total economic output volume will fall to 10 % from the current 18 % in the world 's total , suppose the current population census and the economic trend remain unchanged . "
The statement also warned that " Japan 's proportion will shrink to 4 % from 8 % . "
Israeli Ambassador 's Vandalizing Art Exhibit Sparks Diplomatic Row Between the Two Countries
( AFP report from Stockholm , January 18 ) The dispute , caused by the vandalizing of an art exhibit to remember a Palestinian suicide bomber in Sweden 's National Museum by Israeli ambassador to Sweden Mazel , developed into a full diplomatic row today with the involvement of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon .
Ambassador Mazel vandalized an art exhibit showing a picture of the suicide bomber in Haifa last October after seeing it in an art exhibition in the Museum of Antiquities in Stockholm last Friday . He was expelled by the museum authority , which caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Sweden .
Israel asked Sweden to dismantle the exhibit , which has been refused by Sweden .
The incident has been widely reported by Swedish newspapers .
The exhibition is part of an upcoming international conference on ethnic massacre to be held by the Swedish government . Israel will also attend the meeting .

Israeli Prime Minister Sharon today showed his support to Mazel , pushing the incident to a full diplomatic row .
The exhibit , entitled " Snow White " depicts a ship in the sea . It carries a picture of the smiling Hanadi Jaradat as a sail in the front of the ship .
Hanadi was an intern Palestinian lawyer living in Israel . She launched a suicide bombing attack in northern Israel 's Haifa last October to revenge the killing of his brother by the Israelis , killing 21 Israelis and sparking a new round of Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
Mazel said : " I can 't bear the art exhibit , which also deeply hurts family members of the Haifa bombing victims . As an Israeli ambassador , I can 't do nothing to such an exhibit distorting the facts . "

( AFP report from Washington D.C. , January 18 ) Democratic candidates who hope to replace Bush in the White House pointed out today that the latest suicide bombing attack in Baghdad , which resulted in heavy casualties , had proved the failure of US ' Iraq policy .
The attack , which killed at least 25 people and wounded about 30 others , was the bloodiest one in Baghdad since the United States occupied Iraq .
Bush 's Democratic rivals lashed out at Bush 's Iraq policy . Some rivals said that the attack was the latest proof of the failure of Bush 's Iraq policy .
Senator Edwards from North Carolina told the Columbian Broadcasting Corporation : " Our current policy has failed . I don 't know why the government is not willing to change the way . "
He said : " Obviously , the first thing we need to do is to internationalize the Iraqi security forces and the other thing is to hand over the transitional government to the UN . "
Making a public appearance with Democratic candidate Dean , former President Carter said that the US-led war in Iraq " has proved to be not only based on faulty intelligence and misled statement " , the latest attack has " also persistently shown that it is a tragedy . "

Iraqi Guerrillas Attack US Army Helicopters With Hi-Tech Weapons
( AFP report from Washington D.C. , January 18 ) Senior US army personnel said that Iraqi rebels were attacking US helicopters with more and more sophisticated weapons .
Some senior officials familiar with a classified military report told the New York Times that the classified military research report found that Iraqi guerrillas were attacking US helicopters with rocket-propelled grenades and more advanced thermal targeting ground-to-air missiles .
They said that the research was conducted before the three Iraqi attacks on US army helicopters this month but the latest three attacks would further prove the results of the research report .
The military research report is aimed at offering US army pilots ways to avoid such attacks launched with these weapons by Iraqi guerrillas . Relevant officials are not willing to discuss the new discoveries .
However , the latest round of attacks in Iraq have made people worried that Iraqi guerrillas have carefully studied US military planes ' combat techniques .
Researchers have found that Iraqi guerrillas have used SA-16 shoulder-launched missiles more than once , which is worrying in particular .
Pilots are not easy to avoid such type of missiles with precision-guided systems .
An experienced US pilot in the Persian Gulf region said : " Every downing of our planes is a big victory in the enemy 's strategy .
It will not only be widely reported by the media , but the victory or defeat will be decided immediately so the enemy regards it a useful trick . "
Since October 25 last year , nine US military helicopters have been downed or crashed , killing at least 49 US soldiers .

( AFP report from the town of Plains , Georgia , January 18 ) Former US President Carter has praised former governor of Vermont , candidate Dean 's " courageous and flank " opposition to the Iraqi war before the upcoming preliminary showdown of Democratic Party 's presidential candidates in Iowa .

Carter praised Dean as a strong " peace advocator " . Although he has not mentioned Dean in his statement , US TVs all reported Carter 's remarks .
As a left-wing former governor of a northern state , Dean may be in a difficult situation in the southern states when facing retried general Clark from Arkansas , who holds a middle road . However , Carter 's support may raise his chances to win in the conservative and strong religious-minded southern states .
Speaking in a recent TV interview , Carter said that he believed that Dean was most likely to be the Democratic rival of Bush .

Transportation authority said that the remaining dozens of flights bound for Frankfurt had been delayed and the air traffic could be affected by the weather condition for a whole day .
In France , following the snowfall last night , a traffic blockade was imposed in Paris but similar measures were lifted in the morning in other parts of France .
All the services in Paris 'major airports have been back normal . Yesterday 's heavy snow and fog delayed flights in the De Gaulles Airport .
However , airport authorities in Paris have suggested that air travelers should confirm if their flights were on time before starting their journeys .
Except for the Mediterranean shore , most parts of France have been covered in white snow .
Both Taiwan and Japan are democratic countries and have the obligations and responsibilities to make concerted efforts to consolidate democracy in Asia .
To promote the democratic value , our government will establish the " Taiwan Democratic Fund " in the near future , with international party cooperation one of its major tasks .
The Democratic Progressive Party expects to join hands with democratic parties in other countries through this way to share the experiences of democratic development with other countries in an effort to contribute to Asia 's peace , stability and prosperity and to realize the aspirations of the " Asian Democratic Alliance " in an early date .
At present when the international situation is fast changing , the rise and decline of regional forces concern the overall situation , with all countries ' securities being tested .
In terms of the Asian Pacific region , since the United States launched the war against Iraq , North Korea , which is armed with nuclear weapons , has tested its missiles several times to fly over Japan 's territorial air space ; In addition , China has long been actively building up its military strength and has deployed missiles targeting at Taiwan .
All these have posed a serious threat to the securities of Taiwan and Japan as well as the Asian Pacific region .
These topics relating to democracy build-up and safeguarding the security can only be discussed and settled through a formal security mechanism .
Today 's meeting is the first dialogue on the security issues between parliamentarians from Taiwan 's ruling Democratic Progressive Party and Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party as well as other parties . Its significance is very clear .
I also hope that apart from Taiwan and Japan 's bilateral talks , Asian Pacific countries including the US , Japan and South Korea can cooperate to push forward the establishment of a " security dialogue mechanism " and support Taiwan 's participation in the region 's multilateral dialogue organizations to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .
Today is an important moment to encourage us to keep moving forward on the road of reform . We greatly affirm the fact that all the party comrades are able to show the party 's will to make joint efforts to reach the reform objectives .
" The withdrawal of parties from the media organizations of radio and TV " is the basic requirement in implementing media reform and it is also the firm will of the Democratic Progressive Party . Ruling will only speed up the reform process instead of becoming a hindrance or a burden .
We also know that to achieve the objectives , it is a small but a key step in media reforms for party comrades , who hold public service posts , to take the lead in withdrawing from media operations .
In the past when there were curfews and a media monopoly , in an effort to create more open public opinions , many party comrades had devoted themselves to the arduous task of setting up the fourth station and local radios in a bid to break the then restrictions and inject more momentum for reforming the media environment through this way .
For example , Comrade Cai Tong-rong had devoted much effort for the establishment of the fourth TV station , thus giving birth to the " People 's TV " .
The move exerted great influence on the whole media environment . It , in particular , broke the long-term monopoly by the three stations and created more space for the development of cable TV stations .
However , we must understand that due to limitations of the historical environment , many practices were taken because they could not be otherwise in order to push forward the reforms . So , today when the media environment is totally open and free , the mission of the last stage has been fulfilled . To push forward the reform process , it is a must for us to determine what to keep and what to give up .
The Central Standing Committee has announced that all the party comrades , who hold public service posts , should withdraw from the media operations when the Legislative Council begins its next session on September 5 to set an example of keeping the promise for the people .
We are very gratified that all members are able to keep in mind the party 's aspirations and objectives , including those comrades who contributed a lot during the democratic movement , such as Cai Tong-rong , Zhang Jun-hong , Zhou Qing-yu , Hou Shui-sheng , Gao Meng-ding , Huang Nai-hui and Shen Ming-gong . They are all able to give up their own interests and attach more importance to promoting media reforms .
Ruling does not mean to enjoy power but to shoulder more responsibility .
Despite of the frustrations or ups and down during the administration of the Democratic Progressive Party , we have always been able to convert challenges into a driving force to move forward and stably lead Taiwan to establish the structures for deepening its democracy in line with the world 's common values of democracy , peace and prosperity .
Because we have long been holding that people are the masters of the country , the Democratic Progressive Party 's responsibility is hence to sublime its founding spirit of " Honest and Upright , Diligent Administration , Loving Homeland " to a brighter vision of " Reform , Progress and Good Life " , and to lay a foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the 23 million Taiwan people .
For a long period of time , the Democratic Progressive Party has been playing a role of " shadow government " in expanding Taiwan 's diplomatic efforts and has achieved excellent results .
Despite of Chinese Communist Party 's constant obstructions , we have never retreated because the fate is in our own hands . Though there are no sufficient resources , the Democratic Progressive Party has , step by step , expanded Taiwan 's international participation space .
" Multilateral Diplomacy " has been the core of Democratic Progressive Party 's overall diplomatic strategy . Over the past year , based on the platform of the " Asian Free Democratic Alliance " , we have successfully shared experiences and conducted party exchanges with countries in the region regarding such topics as economic challenges in the East Asian region , democratic reforms of parties , elimination of money politics , settlement of globalization and poverty issues , political publicity and communication as well as the youth 's participation in politics .
I will assume the post of Chairman of " Asian Free Democratic Alliance " next March . I expect to use the capacity as a leader of an international organization to create more opportunities for Taiwan to contribute to the international community .
In addition , since the Democratic Progressive Party became a formal member of " the International Free Alliance " last year , it has been actively engaged in relevant affairs of the organization .
Apart from the fact that it has designated a human right commissioner in the headquarters ' secretariat in London , it will cooperate with other member parties in holding relevant seminars on political reforms in central and south America and in Europe .
On September 28 , our party celebrated its 17th birthday .
The 17-year-old Democratic Progressive Party has long been holding the democratic aspiration and is full of vitality in reforms and progress .
Because we have long been siding with the democratic reform , we have been able to win Taiwan people 's trust . It is also because of this , we will assume more solemn and greater responsibilities and missions in the future .
When we took office as a ruling party three years ago , the previous ruling party had indirectly amended the constitution six times in the 1990s .
From the parliament 's overall re-election in 1991 , the direct presidential election in 1994 , the freeze of provincial government 's organizations in 1997 to the non-standing of the National Assembly in 2000 , the winding course of amending the constitution is in fact a road taken by the Taiwan people to consolidate sovereignty and the legitimacy of democracy .
If we saw the direct presidential election in 1996 as the most important symbol of Taiwan becoming a sovereign democratic country , then the " integrated " state will be ten years old in 2006 .
Following ten years of practice , we must think about what we shall pursue next as a democratic state with independent sovereignty .
I must say that we should further push forward the democracy drive and seek a more efficient constitutional system in order to lead the Taiwan people to take on grim challenges in the new century .
Asia is the world 's largest continent , covering nearly 30 % of the globe 's land , with its population currently accounting for 60 % of and overall economic volume 1 / 4 of the world 's total . It should and is able to make outstanding contributions to the world 's peace and development .
Asia has splendid cultures with a long history . The Yellow River and Yangtze River Valleys , the Indian River and the Ganga River Valleys as well as the Tigris and Euphrates River Valleys are famous birthplaces of human civilizations .
During the long course of history , the Asian people have written a brilliant page in the development of human civilizations .
Since the modern times , Asia has experienced many vicissitudes and suffered a lot of hardships . The peoples of various countries have made unremitting efforts in seeking emancipation and development and made great achievements .
However , Asia has a long way to go before realizing its re-emergence and rejuvenation .
Strengthening cooperation , promoting development and attaining common wins is the only way for Asia to realize its re-emergence and rejuvenation and is also in the basic interests of the Asian people .
Under the new circumstances in the new century , Asia 's development faces new opportunities .
Peace and development remain the theme of the present era . The overall peaceful international environment has offered favorable external conditions for Asia 's development .
The deepening of economic globalization , the fast advancing of the world 's scientific and technological revolution , the optimizing and restructuring of key production factors internationally and the speeding up of industrial transformation are all helpful to Asian countries in making use of international capital , introducing advanced technologies , tapping the world markets and accelerating their economic development .
With abundant natural resources and a huge market , Asia is a region with strongest economic vitality in today 's world and has great development potential .
A huge population and underdevelopment are China 's two national conditions .
China has a population of 1.3 billion . No matter how small a problem is , if it times 1.3 billion , it will become a very big problem ; no matter how significant the financial and material resources are , if divided by 1.3 billion , it will be at a very low per capita level .
This is what the Chinese leaders must keep in mind at any time .
To deal with the problems of its 1.3 billion people , China can depend on no one but itself .
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , we have achieved a lot in construction but have taken some tortuous paths and lost some opportunities at the same time .
Since the reform and opening up in 1978 , we have finally found a right path to develop ourselves .
This is : the Chinese people will independently build socialism with Chinese characteristics .
The pith of the road is to motivate all positive factors to emancipate and develop the productive forces , and respect and safeguard the Chinese people 's freedom in pursuit for well-being .
China 's reform and opening up moved from rural to urban areas and from economic sectors to political , cultural and social sectors .
All in all , its every further step is to free the vigor of all labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital , and let all resources fully play their role in creating social wealth .
Over the past few years , profound changes have been taking place across the world . Science and technology change with each passing day , the level of the world productive forces keeps rising , and the world markets are getting tied closer , offering historic opportunities for the development of all countries .
However , it should be noted that the issues such as power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemic diseases and environment deterioration are still posing threats to the world 's stability and development .
The negative influence of economic globalization has increased the risks and costs of economic and social development of the developing countries . Some developing countries even face the danger of being marginalized .
Currently , although the world economy is gradually recovering , it still faces many uncertain factors .
Complicated factors such as the setback of the Doha multilateral trade talks and trade protectionism have brought more difficulties to developing countries .
It is a relief that many developing countries are actively forging ahead , dedicated to reforms and making themselves prosperous , and have made outstanding achievement .
In the international arena , the developing countries , backed by organizations like the Non-Aligned Movement and Group of 77 , have strengthened their unity and cooperation and contributed a lot to safeguarding their legitimate rights and seeking a change of the irrational international political and economic order , and have become a major force in pushing forward the democratization of the international relations .
Meanwhile , exchanges and cooperation among developing countries are also fruitful , with more frequent economic exchanges taking place .
From the Andes Mountains to the Mekong River , from the establishment of the Union of Maghreb to the founding of the African Union , the content and form as well as the mechanism and measures of the South-South Cooperation are continuously being enriched , perfected and updated .
The past year was also a year that has seen a continuous and full development of Sino-Canadian friendly and cooperative ties .
The two nations ' trade maintained a rising momentum , with the total trade volume reaching nearly $ 10 billion .
There has been frequent high-level exchange of visits . A number of prominent Canadian political figures visited China respectively , including Defense Minister , Environmental Minister and International Cooperation Minister . Chinese high-ranking officials including President of the Chinese Supreme Court and Minister of Commerce also visited Canada respectively . More importantly , the prime ministers of the two counties have successfully exchanged visits .
Premier Wen Jiabao 's recent visit to Canada is significant in carrying forward the course and forging ahead into the future , and has injected new momentum to the further development of Sino-Canadian relations and laid a solid foundation for pushing forward the two countries ' friendly cooperation in all fields to develop more extensively and deeply .
China and Canada will continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the areas of politics , economy , culture and education as well as science and technology and will make great efforts to realize the objective of doubling bilateral trade volume by 2010 .
Fellow countrymen and friends :
Although you are living overseas , your heart has always been connected with the homeland . You have followed the motherland 's construction and development and have shared the worries and happiness of people in the motherland at each critical moment , with your pulse beating with the motherland .
Last year , when SARS and floods hit some parts of China , you expressed your deep concern and best wishes to the people in the motherland through Internet , letters , phone calls and donations . The overseas Chinese people from all walks of life have held a series of large-scale donation activities and benefit performances . After the successful flight of the " Shenzhou-V " manned spacecraft , your telegraphs , letters and cards of congratulations flooded in , expressing your happiness and pride about the achievements made by China 's space science and technology .
During Premier Wen Jiabao 's visit , hundreds of compatriots and overseas students welcomed Premier Wen at the airport in spite of the chilly winds , which was a very touching scene .
Here , I 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you all . I believe in the new year you will continue to make more and greater contributions to China 's prosperity , the development of Sino-Canadian ties , China 's complete unification and its all-round rejuvenation .
Firstly , to strengthen mutual political trust and deepen strategic cooperation .
China and France are both permanent members of the UN Security Council and are countries that exert important influences on international affairs .
Both of our two countries support the acceleration of the world 's multipolarization , hold that the UN 's authority should be safeguarded , and are willing to establish a new international political and economic order which conforms to the wills of all peoples .
Both of us share extensive common ground and interests in dealing with various challenges facing the mankind and properly settling major international affairs .
We are willing to strengthen dialogues and discussions with France on major issues such as fighting against terrorism , anti-proliferation , cracking down on cross-border crimes , pushing forward common development and strengthening UN 's role .
Secondly , to strengthen economic and trade cooperation to realize mutual benefits and complementation .
China is the world 's largest developing country , which is fully engaged in the modernization construction and has a huge market .
France is a developed country and ranks among the world 's best in terms of economic and science and technology development , with leading technologies in many fields .
The economies of our two countries are very mutual complementary , with a great potential for economic and trade cooperation .
Since the founding of new China , the Chinese government has been paying great attention to developing its ties with Africa and has adopted a series of guidelines and policies .
We have been firmly holding the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence , respecting African countries in independently choosing their political systems and development roads , offering assistance to African countries within our ability , carrying out economic and technological cooperation , supporting African nations ' unity and cooperation , pushing the international community to pay attention to Africa 's peace and development , supporting African countries to participate in international affairs on an equal footing , and strengthening Sino-African talks and cooperation to safeguard the rights of developing countries .
Sino-African relations have a long history and are deeply rooted in people 's heart .
Since the founding of new China , we have long been firmly supporting Africa 's national liberation course and has sincerely offered assistance to help African nations develop their national economies .
Chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers dispatched to Africa have been working with the local people and living with them friendly like brothers .
In international affairs , China and African countries have showed mutual understanding of and support and have become partners with mutual trust .
The Chinese people will never forget it was due to the full support of most developing countries including African nations that China 's legitimate right in the UN was resumed at the 26th UN Assembly in 1971 .
Over the past few years , Sino-African political mutual trust at various levels and between different personnel has been deepening . Economic and trade cooperation are fruitful and friendly exchanges in fields of culture and education , healthcare , science and technology and sports have robustly developed . The Sino-African Cooperation Forum set up at the turn of the new century has established a new platform for the development of Sino-African relations and deepening cooperation .
China and Africa have established a long-term and stable new partnership based on equality and mutual benefits . The Sino-African friendly and cooperative ties have entered a new stage of full development .
Seven years after Nixon visited China and the announcement of the Sino-American Shanghai Communiqu , the Carter administration accepted the Chinese stance on the Taiwan issue and realized the establishment of Sino-American diplomatic ties .
This incident and Deng Xiaoping 's successful visit to the United States opened a new chapter in Sino-American relations .
During early stages of the Regan administration , China and the US had severe conflicts over the Taiwan issue .
Following arduous negotiations , the two governments issued the renowned 8.17 Communiqu in 1982 , reaching agreement on phasing down the weapon sales to Taiwan .
The Shanghai Communiqu , the Sino-American Communiqu on Establishing Diplomatic Relations and the 8.17 Communiqu serve as the political cornerstones of Sino-American ties .
During the 10 years after the establishment of diplomatic ties , in spite of the two countries ' occasional conflicts over the Taiwan issue , Sino-American ties remained stable in general and exchanges and cooperation in all fields saw a gradual increase .
In the 1980s and the beginning of 1990s in the 20th century , the Cold War came to an end as East Europe experienced dramatic changes and the Soviet Union dissolved . The international situation underwent the most profound changes since the Second World War .
The United States took the lead in imposing sanctions on China and announced to sell 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan . It linked the human rights issue with the Most Favored Nation Treatment and allowed Lee Teng-hui to visit the US , which brought Sino-American relations to the all-time low .
With China 's rapid economic development , China 's international status is on a rise .
More and more American people have realized that the improvement and development of Sino-American relations is in the interest of the US and China .
Half a year ago , it was right here in the lobby that we successfully launched the six-party talk process and set the direction to peacefully settle the nuclear issue .
Over half a year , all the parties have held non-stop talks and negotiations and have made great and thorough preparations for a new round of talks . Through this process , all sides have promoted the understanding of one another 's stances .
Now , all the parties expect to discuss the core issues during the second round of talks and expect to attain a concrete result . All agree to ease the concerns through concerted steps and expect the peace process the six-party talks have brought about to continue .
These serve as an important basis for our talks today .
The great significance of the second round of talks is to begin the discussions on the core issues , which symbolizes that the peace talks have once again moved one step forward .
This round of talks will cover the issue of how to set a concrete target for settling the nuclear issue and discuss measures to be taken in the first stage to settle the nuclear issue and ways to continue the talks .
As the talks go further , we will deal with more difficulties and face more challenges but this is the responsibility endowed to us by history and it is also the international community 's expectation on us .
The six parties meeting here demonstrated the strong political will of the six governments and their peoples in seeking peace .
Our talks are aimed at expanding the common ground instead of emphasizing the differences . It is aimed at settling problems instead of intensifying the conflicts .
The Chinese side believes that all parties will realize the peace mission they are shouldering , respect each other , show some flexibility and narrow the gap in a constructive way and in a spirit of cooperation and understanding .
Following three days of talks , the second round of Beijing Six-Party Talks has completed its previously-set agendas .
I 'd like to express my thanks to all the governments , leaders of the delegations and representatives as well as the staff members for their contributions .
If the first round of talks has set the great target of realizing a nuclear freeze in the peninsula , then the significance of this round of talks lies in the concrete dialogues , which mark a further step towards the realization of the greater target .
During the talks , all the parties held thorough and constructive discussions , using wisdom and ration to discuss ways and steps to settle the issues , bringing some valuable ideas and having made positive policy announcement .
The talks have achieved a series of beneficial results and , in particular , reached agreement on the next round of talks and the establishment of a working group , which is of great significance in pushing forward the peace talk process .
Dear colleagues , peace and development are the main theme of our great era .
The people of the six countries all of you here represent need peace , aspire for peace and love peace . All the people around the world need peace , aspire for peace and love peace .
Over the past three days , the international community has been watching Beijing and the Diaoyutai and had high expectations on this round of talks .
Perhaps , some people think that the results of the talks are not enough and the process is not fast enough .
In my opinion , this round of talks was launched under the circumstances that the parties concerned lacked mutual trust and their differences were enlarged .
The Chinese government 's stance on the Taiwan issue is consistent . That is to stick to the basic policy of " peaceful reunification , one country and two systems " .
To this end , we have made every possible effort , showed our greatest sincerity and done a lot of work .
However , our efforts are provoked by the Taiwan authority and " Taiwan independence " forces .
We respect Taiwan people 's request for democracy but we oppose " Taiwan independence " forces ' activities to split Taiwan from the motherland in the name of democracy .
That we clearly show our determination and will to safeguard the integrity of the motherland is to protect the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits .
We have stated that we will do our best to peacefully realize the reunification of the motherland as long as there is only a gleam of hope .
We appreciate President Bush 's reiteration of the One China stance , which has given " Taiwan independence " forces a clear signal .
Taiwan leaders have claimed that " in order to prevent China 's use of force to invade Taiwan and unilaterally change the status quo , it will hold the 3.20 peaceful referendum . "
This is to defame the mainland 's peace efforts and to provoke the cross-strait relations .
Currently , the actual threat to Taiwan 's security does not come from the mainland but from the " Taiwan independence " split-up activities by the Taiwan authority .
The " Taiwan independence " split-up forces are the direct root that undermines cross-strait status quo and harms the peace in the Taiwan Strait .
Taiwan authority has distorted the mainland 's opposition to the " Taiwan independence " split-up moves and its safeguarding the stability in the Taiwan Strait as cracking down on Taiwan 's democracy and freedom , and has used it as an excuse to hold the referendum .
This is a fabrication and distortion of facts and aimed at swindling sympathy and support for continuing its split-up policy .
What Taiwan leaders have claimed are the so-called " defense referendum " and " peace referendum " , but no matter how it is packed , such provocative move will only lead to the cross-strait antithesis and hatred , intensify cross-strait relations and push the cross-strait ties to a dangerous brink .
This goes against Taiwan compatriots ' mainstream will of seeking peace , stability and development . It is not to deepen Taiwan 's " democracy " but to mislead and control Taiwan people and is also a serious threat to the peace and stability in the Asian Pacific region , which is surely to draw widespread opposition from compatriots across the strait and the international community .
Taking a sweeping view of the Chinese nation 's historical development , unification has always been the mainstream and is the trend of the times and people 's will .
With the motherland becoming more and more powerful and the cross-strait cooperation being increasingly strengthened , the international community 's widespread recognition of one China has been consolidated . Any split-up attempt is doomed to failure .
The Lunar New Year is just two weeks away , which is one of the most important traditional festivals of the Chinese people .
During these lively and happy days , we have the custom of gathering with family members and friends and exchange gifts to express our wishes .
In the spirit of conveying regards and creating business opportunities , Hong Kong Post Service is cooperating with China Post to offer Hong Kong residents the " China-Hong Kong gift delivery service " to convey regards and good wishes to family members , friends and customers living in the mainland or local Hong Kong .
For a long time , Hong Kong Post Service has been dedicated to the cooperation with other post services to offer international delivery services .
As early as December 2002 , it has offered foreign wine delivery service with Australia Post Service to provide good quality goods to Hong Kong residents .
The cooperation with China Post this time is to expand the close bilateral cooperation in the areas of postal service , postal remittance and express delivery to cross-border logistics services . The " China-Hong Kong gift delivery service " is specially designed to meet the increasing market demand for Hong Kong residents to deliver gifts to family members , friends and customers living in the mainland .
The first batch of gifts include several kinds of delicately packaged gift boxes for the New Year , including sweets , tea and seafood , with different prices and varieties to choose .
They are very decent gifts for family members , friends or business partners living in the mainland .
Over the past 30 years , it has been perfectly obvious that the Consumers ' Right Association has made its contribution to protecting consumers ' rights .
To evaluate the work of the Consumers ' Rights Association , it is better to see whether consumers ' rights have been substantially improved .
I fully agree with what Chairman Chen said just now . Over the past 30 years , not only the consumers have become aware of their own rights , all walks of life are paying more attention to consumer rights as well . This is the result of efforts made by the Consumers ' Right Association and the government .
The Consumers ' Right Association conducts regular tests on products , carries out market investigations and research of industrial operations regarding various products and services , and issues just and objective market information to the public through the monthly magazine " Choices " .
The monthly magazine " Choices " has won the deep trust of the residents . The current Internet edition of " Choices " will give full play to its functions and will help consumers get quick access to market information .
The Consumers ' Rights Association has 11 regional consumer consulting centers and 16 hot lines to offer consumers information about relevant products and services and accept their complaints .
Since its establishment , the Consumers ' Rights Association has received an increasing number of inquires , from thousands of cases in 1970s when it was first established to 146,000 cases last year , an increase by 20 times . This shows that more and more consumers will refer to the reports and comments issued by the Consumers ' Rights Association before they choose products and services .
In addition , the Consumers ' Rights Association handled more than 26,000 complaint cases this year .
The Consumers ' Rights Association occasionally criticizes individual tricky shops by name , which not only help prevent consumers from being cheated , but also aims to throw a scare into the business operators .
Legislator Yang , on July 1 , I told you that I watched TV very closely and have done some reflection later . I saw the residents ' complaints and anger and their dissatisfaction with the government 's administration .
In this respect , the government and I have been making improvements over the past 6 to 7 months . We have noticed that what the residents asked was for us to build a good economy and handle the issue of people 's well-being . We have made a lot of efforts in this regard . The residents have a lot of complaints about the 23rd Article of the " Basic Law " , so we have revoked the 23rd Article . In fact , the government has given an instant response .
As for the society 's request for democracy , I also know it well .
However , Legislator Yang , I 'd like to tell you what I 'm doing today is to ensure that everything goes smoothly after political self-criticism begins . Therefore , some basic issues should be addressed first . These are two different things .
What are the basic issues ?
These are issues concerning the principles . Some are legal issues concerning the relevant provisions of the " Basic Law " that are subject of our political self-criticism . How to understand it exactly is to first have this work well done .
We are doing this work right now . A three-member team has begun doing this job .
It will first consult with the central government and will also listen to people 's advice in Hong Kong . I think this is a good step and it is a decision that shows we are paying attention to opinions of the Hong Kong society .
In today 's fiercely competitive business environment , brands are playing a key role in the success of products .
To create a name brand cannot be done in just one day . It requires creative designs , good quality , interesting packages , effective marketing and constant investment .
Hong Kong has the conditions for creating famous brands .
We have relevant expertise , techniques and experience ; we have a rich resource of talents in the fields of designing , manufacturing , marketing and management . We also have a broad market .
The recent implementation of CEPA will increase our advantages . Apart from the zero tariffs for entering the mainland 's market , its biggest advantage is to inspire businessmen to use their brains in an effort to increase the added value of their products and make the products become consumers ' popular brands in Hong Kong , mainland and all around the world .
The " Hong Kong Top Ten Renowned Brands Contest " launched by the Association of China Enterprises happens to coincide with CEPA 's role in guiding Hong Kong products to develop in the way of high added value .
Over the past five years , 51 " Hong Kong Top Ten Renowned Brands " have been honored in the contest .
However , facing mainland 's huge market , the 51 famous brands are really nothing . We need hundreds , thousands and more " Hong Kong Famous Brands " .
Hong Kong Subway has actively participated in subway projects in major cities around the mainland and has introduced into the mainland market their rich experiences through services .
I 'm very pleased to see the mainland market 's affirmative appraisal of Hong Kong 's investment , professional services and the quality of management personnel .
This kind of exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong are not only helpful to the motherland 's development , but also can create more development opportunities for Hong Kong businessmen . Apart from accelerating the economy , it will also create more job opportunities for Hong Kong .
Thanks to the support by the central government and Shenzhen Special Economic Zone , a principle agreement on this project has been reached .
This is the first time that the subway company goes beyond Hong Kong to participate in mainland subway development by way of investment , which will further introduce Hong Kong 's brands to the mainland . It is really a good news for Hong Kong people and the countrymen in the mainland .
Here , I 'd like to express my best wishes that the Fourth Subway Line in Shenzhen will be officially approved by the central government in an early date and the project 's construction will go smoothly to lay a more solid foundation for more exchanges and cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the future .
Today is the fifth day of the Lunar New Year . I 'm very pleased to be invited by the gold and silver trade circle to attend your New Year greeting gathering and host the New Year 's opening ceremony for the gold market opening session .
First , I 'd like to express my New Year greetings to you all and wish you to be full of vigor , good lucks and fortunes , and to fulfill your wills in the Year of Monkey .
Over the past year , the gold price has gone up dramatically . It even went beyond $ 400 per ounce recently , keeping a strong momentum and reflecting investors ' recovering confidence in gold .
I believe that our counterparts have also been very busy over the past year .
In fact , while the booming market is influenced by the outer factors , it is also a result of great efforts made by the gold and silver trade circle over the past 90 years .
These efforts have not only laid a good foundation for Hong Kong 's gold market , but also contributed much more to Hong Kong 's position as an international financial center .
As the saying goes , " a whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring " . I hope all members in the gold and silver trade circle will continue to make efforts next year to grasp the " golden time " of the gold and silver business , seize the opportunity of a rise in gold demand brought by the mainland 's gold market reforms , China 's accession into the WTO and implementation of CEPA , and continually push forward market development .
I believe with the active efforts by people of the our trade , Hong Kong 's gold market will become more splendid .
Finally , I wish booming gold trade and all trades and businesses prosperous in the Year of Monkey .
Thank you all .
However , the previous challenges not only lay in funding the public houses , private houses also faced a big test .
After the outbreak of 1997 financial crisis , the capital foams burst , leading to a sharp decline of housing prices by 70 % and severely hitting the owners . It was also the main cause for the deterioration of deflation over the past five years .
Now the economy is recovering . We are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sustainable and stable development of the housing market .
A healthy housing market is indeed of great importance to Hong Kong 's economic recovery .
We are also dedicated to protecting and improving the living environment .
Our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development to adopt better urban designs , strengthen the protection of Hong Kong 's natural and historical scenic spots and improve the living environment .
We will pay more attention to the issue of the overall environment .
The lesson of last year 's outbreak of SARS epidemic in Hong Kong has reminded us to make efforts to create a cleaner and healthier living environment .
We are intensifying our efforts to beautify the environment , plant more trees and build more parks and recreational facilities for use by the residents .
Here , I 'd like to express my thanks to several legislators who have made comments on the administration of justice and laws , politics , public servants , auspices organizations ' employees and safety guards in the Chief Executive 's Administration Policy Report .
On the scope of judicial and legal services , only Legislator Wu Heyi and Legislator Zeng Yucheng made their comments . They are Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee under the Legislative Council .
In his Administration Policy Report , the Chief Executive has proposed several measures to push forward people-oriented administration , including the strengthening of ties between major officials and the society , conducting more public policy researches , strengthening cooperation between the government and the Legislative Council and making serious review of the administrative system .
The Department of Law and Justice will fully participate in the above-mentioned work and is dedicated to ensuring that all government measures are in accordance with laws and procedures , especially the Basic Law , including its protection of residents ' basic rights and freedom . It will also keep vigilant as stated by Legislator Wu Heyi to safeguard Hong Kong 's legal system and justice independence .
As a key official , I will do my best to heed to the opinions of the public and the legal circle regarding issues which may cast influence on judicial affairs and the legal profession .
For example , the Mainland-Hong Kong Closer Economic and Trade Partnership Arrangement is an achievement of close cooperation between the government and the various sectors , including the Association of Big Lawyers , the Association of Lawyers and the Chinese Association of Entrustment Notary .
We have successfully included " legal service " under CEPA , which has become one of the mainland 's service sectors that are open to the outside . It has provided a new platform for the two sides to strengthen their legal service cooperation .
The Special Team 's work is two-way . We will report our work of collecting the public opinions in Hong Kong to the central government .
So far , we have received over 10 groups and individuals since mid-January this year .
All the people agree that Hong Kong 's political development needs to conform to " One Country , Two Systems " . The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is directly under the leadership of the central government .
Most of them think that Hong Kong 's political system needs some improvement . Meanwhile , all of them agree that any development should conform to the Basic Law .
Some groups and individuals also have their own opinions about some procedures and legal issues .
The Special Team will fully convey their wills , opinions and comments to the central government .
In the coming one month or more , the Special Team will continue to receive other groups and individuals . We will continue to report received comments to the central government .
This is just the first time that the Special Team meets with relevant departments of the central government . In the future , we will still need to follow up the work and communicate with the central government .
I believe that all of you understand that the development of political system concerns the relationship between the central government and the special administrative region . The central government also has the constitutional power and obligation to review the special administrative region 's political development . We need to hold thorough discussions with the central government .
The West Kowloon Recreational Art Zone is a large-scale cultural and artistic program that Hong Kong has never undertaken before . It is not only a program that offers residents a space for cultural and artistic recreations , but also one that can improve the quality of the residents and the city .
The construction of the West Kowloon Recreational Art Zone belongs to the whole Hong Kong society .
The government must continue to hold thorough discussions with all walks of life to pool the wisdom of the masses .
We understand that we cannot only seek beautiful architectures , instead we need to ensure that they will have economic efficiency , achieve sustainable development and improve the residents ' living quality .
Therefore , the government pays great attention to the supporting software facilities of the West Kowloon Recreational Art Zone . They must be kept in line with the relevant measures , including facility management policies , promotion strategies for artistic performances , and publicity strategies regarding performances and exhibitions .
The formulation of these relevant strategies must be based on the opinions carefully absorbed from the " customers " .
The younger generation , including every young friend here , are among the main customers of the West Kowloon Recreational Art Zone in the future .
We hope that the Zone can satisfy the needs of both the old and young . Both Hong Kong residents and visitors , adults and lively young people , would be so enchanted here that they feel reluctant to leave .
I know you held discussions on several different aspects of the West Kowloon Recreational Art Zone this morning . Some students have devoted much effort in preparation of theme reports over the past month . I believe you are already very familiar with the details of the program .
I am eager to find out the results of your discussions and exchange views with you .
Since the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , the whole world has been paying its attention to the security of sea ports , airports and borders .
As the world 's largest port which transports the largest number of containers to the United States , Hong Kong has undoubtedly quickly responded to the " port security proposal " raised by the United States .
In addition , we believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist groups is also an effective way to curb terrorist activities .
The law enforcement agencies targeting crimes and money laundry have long been perplexed by the large amount of flow of funds through the world 's financial systems every day .
As one of major financial centers in Asia , we believe that cutting off terrorists ' funds is perhaps the most effective way to crack down on their structures once and for all .
Currently , Hong Kong 's legislative agencies are holding discussions on various proposals for improvement in order to tighten the current laws and regulations to crack down on funding terrorist activities , and actively coordinating with the international standards and situation , such as the new advice offered by the special team of cracking down on money laundry activities , to amend the laws .
In addition , we are seeking to adopt more perfect regulations on information disclosure to enable relevant agencies and individuals to report suspicious transactions .
" Balance " is also a key in this work : effective investigation power , the freedom protected by the constitution , personal privacies , the efficiency of economic and financial systems are all factors that need to be considered .
Our control measures are based on legal systems , transparency , equality and efficiency .
In fact , Hong Kong 's service industry has a number of advantages in a wide range of fields .
Hong Kong 's professional and business service talents are very familiar with international and mainland 's business operations
Hong Kong 's professional accountant , financial , legal and arbitration services are the best partners of enterprises in the mainland during their course of internationalization and linking to the world markets .
As for our transportation , construction , design and marketing , management consultancy , information technology and conference as well as exhibition services , they are helpful for mainland 's enterprises to improve their overall productivity and competitiveness and assist enterprises and products in drawing up market expansion strategies and improve the image of their brands .
And tourism , healthcare and insurance services are more helpful to the development of mainland 's relevant markets and sectors to improve their service standards .
The close cooperation between the two sides ' service industries will greatly enhance their respective advantages and is helpful for them to face various opportunities and challenges brought about by economic globalization .
To promote the service industry 's development in the mainland market , the Director of the Financial Department and I , along with officials from relevant policy and enforcement departments and representatives of several sectors , held substantial and valuable discussions in Beijing with mainland 's relevant departments and counterparts on topics of mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other issues of concern by the industry .
We are pleased to have signed agreements on mutual professional qualification recognition and cooperation in the three areas of construction , structure engineering and insurance , which is an important step taken by our service industry in order to develop in the mainland market .
After the meeting , Hong Kong 's professional groups have also established closer ties with mainland 's administrative agencies to lay a good foundation for the friendly cooperation in the next stage .
I believe most of the Hong Kong residents love their motherland and Hong Kong .
In fact , the economic , social , political and cultural links and relationships between the mainland and Hong Kong have long been closely bound up before and after Hong Kong 's return .
In the economic front , we 've seen that since the country 's Four Modernization drive and the reform and opening up launched over 20 years ago , Hong Kong 's industries have had the opportunities to move to the north and find a new development space , which has drawn closer the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland .
Recently , we have the opportunity to reach the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with the central government , which enables Hong Kong 's service sectors to gain new opportunities to more actively and extensively participate in mainland 's economic development and make contributions to the nation and Hong Kong . It will also draw closer the ties between Hong Kong and the mainland .
In social development , we 've noticed that the country develops with giant strides with each passing day .
Hong Kong residents are very happy to see Beijing 's successful bid for the 2008 Olympic Games .
Several months ago , Hong Kong people were also pleased to see Yang Liwei 's visit to Hong Kong , why ?
Because everybody and every Hong Kong resident is proud of such achievement of the nation .
I know the Legislative Council began to discuss the issue of a permanent Legislative Council office building with the government as early as 10 years ago .
Likewise , the government has been considering a long-term plan of moving the government headquarters over the past 10 years .
So , I understand that some legislators will be disappointed by the government 's decision to postpone the Tianmajian development project , which includes the new Legislative Council building .
I understand that the legislators will feel wronged to continue their work in a poor environment during this period of time .
However , as I 've told the colleagues in the government who have also been affected by the decision , I hope all of you will first think about the public interests , understand relevant situations and be more patient during this period of time .
I had explained to the Administrative Management Commission of the Legislative Council earlier several times . The government , taking into consideration of the current financial situation and that following last year 's SARS outbreak , believes that it is not the right time now to carry out the Tianmajian construction project or the construction of other large-scale office buildings .
The postponement of construction of the new Legislative Council office building at Tianmajian will help ease the government 's financial burden over the coming few years . It is in the interests of the public and will be accepted by the public .
The government will restart the new Legislative Council office building construction project in Tianmajian when the public financial situation sees some improvement . That is what we are planning to do .
The country is very concerned about Hong Kong . The president and the premier are also very concerned about Hong Kong . We know that they and the central government will do their best to have this job well done .
Good news will continue to come in the areas of tourism , finance , infrastructure construction coordination , shipping rights , zero tariffs of products and the service sectors .
I also sincerely hope that with its economic recovery , Hong Kong will make better use of its advantages to make greater contributions to the national development .
During my meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao , I , on behalf of Hong Kong , expressed my congratulation to the nation 's proud achievement under his leadership over the past difficult year . Although the future will still be full of challenges , as you 've listened to his work report , he is full of confidence , which has deeply inspired us .
Premier Wen told me that it was of great significance for us to fully understand the policy of " One Country , Two Systems " by reviewing Mr. Deng Xiaoping 's important exposition on " One Country , Two Systems " 20 years ago , which is helpful to the development of our political system in the future .
He also told me that Hong Kong people should really grasp this opportunity and focus on economic development to improve people 's well-being . He said he had full confidence in Hong Kong .
Later , I 'll meet with Guangdong Party Sectary Mr. Zhang Dejiang and Governor Mr. Huang Huahua to discuss with them how to further promote our cooperation and gain a bigger two-win on the current basis .
The last point is " Hong Kong administered by Hong Kong people " that has been very familiar to you recently . This policy requires that Hong Kong should be administered by people consisting mainly of Hong Kong patriots .
As for patriots , there has been a very definite standard . They should be Hong Kong residents who are patriotic and respect and love their nation , who sincerely support the country 's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong , and who will not do things to harm the country and Hong Kong . This is what a patriot is . These patriots shall form the mainstay in the administration of Hong Kong .
I 'd like to reiterate that most of the Hong Kong residents love their country .
Here , I 'm not referring to the ordinary Hong Kong residents , but those who participate in Hong Kong 's public affairs and the senior members in the administrative , legislative and judicial agencies .
When they are sworn into office , they are required to express their support to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China according to the Basic Law and to pledge their loyalty to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China .
The five or six principles and important considerations I mentioned above are actually long-term guidelines and policies that have been adopted since the 1980s when Hong Kong 's future was discussed and the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law were formulated . They have remained unchanged and will never change because these are a series of long-term guidelines and policies for the country to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and are the country 's basic policies , which will never change .
Great inventions of far-reaching significance have come about one after another since the birth of the intellectual property right system hundreds of years ago and since the industrial revolution in particular .
Over the past 20 years , the intellectual property right system has served as a basic legal system and an important policy to accelerate technological renovations in various countries , and has played a key role in developing the economy and increasing international competitiveness .
Currently , with the fast development of science and technology and the economic globalization , the creation , occupation and the use of knowledge and intelligence resources as well as the number and the quality of owned intellectual property rights have become an important basis for a country to participate in the international competition .
Therefore , the strengthening of international exchanges and cooperation on protection of intellectual property rights is of great significance in establishing a just and rational international economic new order and promoting the world 's economic prosperity and development .
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights .
From the beginning of reforms and opening up , our country has started to build the intellectual property right system . Following 20 years of efforts , we have formed a relatively complete intellectual property right legal system and established an intellectual property right protection system combined with legal and administrative enforcement . We 've done a lot of work in the protection of intellectual property rights and made important contributions to accelerating scientific and technological progress as well as social and economic development .
As mankind enters the information society in the 21st century , the scientific and technological revolutions will generate unprecedented driving force in pushing forward the development of social productivity .
The further improvement of our country 's intellectual property right system and strengthening of international exchanges and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property rights are necessary in order to further open up our country in the new century . It is also required for building a socialist modern country and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
We are willing to join hands with all the countries to make great efforts to establish a just and rational intellectual property right system that is helpful to promote the science and technology development in various countries and to create a sound environment in terms of respecting knowledge , advocating science and technology and protecting intellectual property rights .
To speed up the organization 's mechanism construction is the current top priority facing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization .
Through all parties ' concerted efforts , great progress has been made in the preparation work for the establishment of the secretariat and a regional anti-terrorism agency .
We will continue to make efforts to ensure the official launch of the secretariat within this year and the establishment of the regional anti-terrorism agency at an earlier possible date .
As the host country of the organization 's secretariat , the Chinese government has decided to offer a secretariat office building for free to show that it pays great importance to the Shanghai Organization .
In the future , we will also continue to offer full support to the smooth operation of the secretariat .
Deepening and expanding security cooperation have long been the priorities of the Shanghai Organization .
We will never lose our vigilance on and tolerate the " three forces " , which pose great threats to member states across this region .
We should make long-standing and unremitting efforts to eliminate these evil forces to effectively safeguard the peace and stability of the region .
We should list the anti-drug issue onto the security cooperation agenda as soon as possible in order to cut off the funding of the " three forces " and to more completely and effectively crack down on the " three forces " .
Economic cooperation is an important basis and prior task for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization .
Education is the cornerstone of modern civilization .
To raise the quality of the nationals and to improve the state 's comprehensive strength , education must be greatly developed .
Rural education has a widespread influence and concerns the rural economy and the overall social development .
Since the reforms and opening up , great and substantial changes have taken place in our country 's rural areas , which are highly attributable to the development of education , especially the rural education .
The adoption of the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output in rural areas has greatly emancipated the productive forces .
There is a reason as to why it has been possible to see the widespread use of advanced and practical technologies in agriculture , the emerging of rural enterprises and the large movement of surplus rural labor forces to costal regions and urban areas . A fundamental cause is the solid basis of hundreds of millions of rural labor who have received compulsory education . The popularization of compulsory education in rural areas has been very fruitful and cannot be ignored .
Currently , our country 's agricultural and rural economic development has come to a critical stage . An overall improvement of the quality of the rural labor force is urgently needed for developing a high-quality , high efficiency , environmentally friendly and safe agriculture , for expansion of rural industrial business operations and for movement of surplus rural labor forces .
The emergence of the world 's new scientific and technological revolution and the drive for building a better-off society have raised a higher demand on the rural population with respect to the quality in such areas as science and technology , culture , ideology and ethics .
Without the comprehensive " Nine-Year Compulsory Education " and the overall improvement of the farmers ' quality , the target of a fully better-off society is hard to reach .
We must fully understand the basic , leading and overall role of rural education in the full construction of a better-off society .
The consultants and distinguished guests attending the meeting include senior leaders of famous multinational corporations , renowned international economists and experienced experts as well as scholars .
I 've deeply felt the consultants ' sincere spirit of cooperation and positive and practical attitude .
To give a full play of our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom is not only helpful to planning and promoting Guangdong 's development , but also to promoting our cooperation and development in all fields .
I have been looking forward to the " 2003 International Consultancy Conference on Guangdong 's Economic Development " to listen to your valuable advice on Guangdong 's economic and social development .
Today , we meet here for one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchanges , expand the space for development , inject vitality to Guangdong 's economic and social development and to create opportunities for your own development .
China 's accession into the WTO symbolizes a new stage of its opening up . We are now participating in the international competitions more extensively , in broader fields and at a higher level .
Guangdong is a province in the Chinese mainland with a most overseas-oriented economy and it has first faced the development opportunities and grim challenges ever seen .
Under such circumstances , we must tightly seize new opportunities , face new challenges , improve the overall international competitiveness , actively push forward the modernization drive and make great efforts to break new grounds for economic cooperation in order to realize mutual complement of advantages , mutual benefits , long-term cooperation and common development .
Guangdong people are dedicated to the full construction of a better-off society and speeding up the modernization drive , which will create more development opportunities and space for all friends .
Guangdong 's economy , which is full of vitality and broad prospect , is moving to a higher level with a strong momentum .
The Iraqi Temporary Governing Council and the US occupation authority have recently signed an agreement , announcing a timetable for returning power to Iraq in stages by next June .
The agreement has been barely accepted by the international community . Although the EU 's foreign minister meeting welcomed the agreement , France said " the process is too slow " . While " inspired " by the power transfer plan , UN Secretary General Annan said that UN 's role in Iraq was " premature " . Russia has cast doubts on the legitimacy of the agreement .
The Iraqi people have a cold response . The US media even believe that " this is a big gamble " .
All in all , people have cast doubts on it and would rather wait and see .
It 's not without reason that the international community has great doubts on it .
Because people have noticed that the US is not willing to hand over the power back to Iraq . The handover will be incomplete and is sure to leave many problems .
Firstly , members of the transitional government to be set up next May are not directly elected by the Iraqi people , instead they will be elected by the " Transitional National Representative Congress " to be elected by the election committees in 18 provinces .
It is hard to clear the doubt of being controlled by the US . Its legitimacy will also be doubted .
Secondly , after announcing the power transfer , the US army will not withdraw . The only change will be from the original " military occupation " to " military presence " .
The US government announced on November 18th that it had decided to impose quota restrictions on three Chinese textile export products , including textile cloth , bras and robes .
It is very regrettable that the US government 's trade protectionist move came as China was making continuous efforts to expand Sino-US bilateral economic and trade cooperation .
Under the current economic globalization , it is very inappropriate for the US to reset quotas on Chinese textile exports .
Firstly , such abuse of " quotas " hinders the implementation of WTO 's free trade principle .
While advocating " free trade " on one hand , it has frequently resorted to the " quota " on the other hand to rebuild a trade barrier . Doesn 't this seem too arbitrary and unfair ?
Secondly , the " quota " has curbed the good momentum of the Sino-US economic and trade development .
Since China and the US reached agreement on China 's accession into the WTO in 1999 , the US exports to China have seen an average rise of 15 % annually .
From January to September this year , US exports to China rose 26.2 % compared with the same period last year .
Over the past two years , the exports of US textile material and finished products to China went up sharply .
In fact , today 's China has become a country that receives the fastest increase of US exports in the world .
Bush 's failure to reach his targets during his visit to Britain has many causes , the most important of which is that after the end of the Cold War , the US has become the world 's sole superpower , disregarding anyone else under its swelling unilateralism .
The US launched the war against Iraq without UN authorization and has showed no respect to its allies ' advice on major international issues including Iraq 's reconstruction . Its stubbornness has aroused widespread resentment .
A recent poll issued by the European Commission showed that 68 % of EU 's citizens held that the US did not have sufficient reasons to launch the war against Iraq while 53 % believed that the US posed threats to the world 's peace .
Secondly , the US stresses anti-terrorism and expects its allies to provide personnel and funds while turning a blind eye to their concerns .
The US is holding tightly in hands Iraq 's reconstruction projects and has offered the first contract bids to domestic companies , unwilling to share with others . In the steel trade dispute , the WTO has ruled that the US high tariffs are against its regulations . The British business and industrial sectors had expected Bush to make some concessions during his visit but he failed to respond to the request .
Thirdly , the US regards its values as the top ones and has imposed them on other countries . It insists on carrying out democratic reforms in the Middle East countries , which has drawn oppositions . Some allied countries have asked the US to respect Islamic nations ' culture and unique characteristics , believing that one of the causes that has led to US army 's being bogged down in Iraq is the bitter pill of its " disrespect " .
However , Bush will not change his mind in spite of extensive criticism and oppositions . He , once again , defended his policy towards Iraq , stressing that the US-British allied forces would continue to resort to force to deal with the violence in Iraq .
Just as Bush has failed to have his wishes fulfilled during his visit to Britain , the situation in Iraq may fail as well to develop in a way that the White House expects .
Following half a year 's debate , an advance team of Japan 's Self-Defense Force was eventually deployed to Iraq at the end of 2003 .
This was the first time that Japan has deployed troops in an overseas battlefield since the end of the Second World War .
It reflects Japan 's will of becoming a political and military power and also symbolizes the change of Japan 's defense strategies .
The deployment of the Self-Defense Force has attracted great attention , as it is not an isolated incident .
Japan has used the opportunity of the war in Afghanistan to make a breakthrough of deploying the Self-Defense Force abroad . It has made use of the issue of the Korean Peninsular to adopt the " Emergency Legislation " to foreshadow the Self-Defense Force 's use of force and even launching preemptive attacks . Koizumi 's cabinet has recently passed " the Basic Plan of Supporting Iraq 's Reconstruction " , which has foreshadowed sending troops to Iraq .
Step by step , it has eventually broken the restrictions imposed by Japan 's Peaceful Constitution and sent troops to overseas battlefields .
In addition , Japan is also seeking to amend " the Conception for Basic Defense Forces " in 2004 to legalize and perpetuate overseas military deployment and plans to set up a " permanent troop " for overseas deployment .
Meanwhile , citing the so-called " North Korean missile threats " , the Japanese cabinet meeting has decided to deploy a missile defense system at the beginning of 2004 , introducing the US " Standard-3 Missile " and the " Patriots-3 Missile " to intercept outer atmosphere missiles and missiles returning to the atmosphere , building a double missile interception network .
It is not hard to see that Japan 's Self-Defense Force is moving toward a regular army that is capable of " attacks and defense " . The " Self-Defense Force " that is so called " specializing in defense " will exist in name only .
That the Japanese move has attracted much attention is firstly because these military decisions have impacts on Japan 's peaceful constitution .
After his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine , Koizumi accepted Japanese reporters ' interview to defend his action .
His remarks were full of contradictions and loopholes .
The reporters asked Koizumi why he paid respect to the shrine . Koizumi answered : " Japan 's peace and prosperity were realized at the sacrifice of the war victims .
My paying respect is to pray for Japan 's peace and prosperity . "
Just ask , do Koizumi 's so-called " war victims " include World War II Class A war criminals including Hideki Tojo ?
Does he mean that Japan 's post-war peace and prosperity should be attributed to the contributions of those Class A war criminals ?
Some reporters asked why he chose January 1 to pay his respect to the Yasukuni Shrine .
Koizumi said that it was a Japanese tradition to worship in temples on the first day of the New Year and many people go to temples to worship .
It is understandable that ordinary people mourn relatives and friends , and many victims ' family members have clearly stated that they worshiped in the Shrine only to mourn their relatives and friends and firmly opposed enshrining Class A war criminals in the Yasukuni Shrine .
The Chinese people are reasonable . We firmly hold that the Japanese people should be separated from a small number of militarists and the ordinary people should be separated from the rightists . The ordinary people ' paying respect to the Yasukuni Shrine is not the crux of historical issues .
Unity is strength .
This is an irrefutable truth .
To reach the great target of the full construction of a better-off society and complete the solemn undertaking of the Chinese nation 's rejuvenation , we must unite all forces that can be united .
The work of the patriotic united front in the new century and the new stage must be based on and carried out in accordance with this .
We will further stick to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front and bring every positive factor into play to inject new momentum to the Chinese nation 's great rejuvenation .
Over the past year , the People 's Political Consultancy Conference has been sticking to the two themes of unity and democracy , earnestly fulfilling various obligations , and has played an important role in accelerating the country 's overall economic and social development and in safeguarding a stable situation for reform and development .
In the new year , we hope that the People 's Political Consultancy Conference will , by focusing on the prior tasks of the Party and the nation , do a better job in political consultation , democratic supervision and participation in political affairs . We also hope that it will carry on its good tradition , make use of its own advantages , conduct thorough investigations and researches , actively offer advice and contribute more to the full construction of a better-off society .
From January 4 to 6 , the 12th Leaders Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , which was postponed for one full year , was held in Islamabad . The conference has adopted several documents including the " South Asian Free Trade Agreement Framework Treaty " , " SAARC 's Annex Agreement on Anti-Terrorism " and the " South Asian Social Charter " . It announced that SAARC members would be dedicated to the common development and cooperation in the fields of economy , culture and anti-terrorism .
During the SAARC conference , the bilateral talks between Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Musharraf had attracted much attention .
At the last summit meeting , Musharraf and Vajpayee shook hands with each other , but people had not expected too much in the development of the two country 's bilateral relations .
Two years later , due to the two sides ' series of key moves of normalizing diplomatic ties , resuming land and air transportation and realizing a cease-fire in the Kashmir region , Indian-Pakistani ties continue to ease up and their top leaders have eventually held talks using the opportunity of the SAARC meeting .
The two countries have moved one big step in improving bilateral ties . South Asia 's regional cooperation is facing a turn for the better .
Although Indian Foreign Minister Singh said on 4th that the talks were of " courtesy " , people believe that the meeting symbolizes that Indian-Pakistani ties will make more positive and practical changes .
The two leaders have realized that tension and confrontation are not in the interests of their own countries but will lead to missed economic development opportunities .
With the on-going economic globalization , strengthening cooperation and developing economy have become the top priorities of the two governments .
Although there is no official announcement of the result of Georgia 's presidential election on 4th , A victory by the National Movement Party leader Saakashvili , who is a candidate recommended by the right-wing party alliance , is inevitable .
Georgia 's Central Election Committee announced on 7th that based on 89 % votes already counted , more than 95 % voters supported Saakashvili .
Some heads of states of the Commonwealth of Independent States have sent congratulatory telegraphs to the young politician .
In fact , as early as on the night of the election , Saakashvili had already announced his victory .
He claimed that the result was the " victory of the people " and said that Georgia would take quick moves to create a new future .
When interviewed by news medias , many voters said that voting for Saakashvili meant choosing " new hopes " .
Even former President Shevardnadz , who was forced to step down , also expressed his support to his former political opponent , praising him as " young , energetic and well educated " .
While placing hopes on Saakashvili , people have also noticed that after the resignation of Shevardnadz , no great changes have taken place in the situation of Georgia .
This is to say that the newly-elected president will still have to face the old problems .
The past year was an important and very unusual one in our country 's development course .
We fought an arduous war against the sudden appearance of the SARS epidemic and won a great victory ; our economy maintained a good development momentum and has entered a new stage , with the per capita GDP topping $ 1,000 ; the Shenzhou-VI spacecraft completed a successful flight , realizing Chinese people 's dream of space flight ; The nation is united , the society is progressing and the people 's living standards keep improving .
Our country 's achievements in various fields have attracted the world 's attention . All the people in the country have made great efforts and shown their courage and strength of creating wonders in spite of difficulties .
Looking forward to the new year , we are full of confidence and hopes .
Looking at the domestic and international situations , our country is at an important moment full of strategic opportunities that we must tightly grasp and are able to make great achievements .
We should stick to the guidelines of the important thoughts of the Deng Xiaoping Theory and the " Three Represents " , fully carry through the party 's essences of the 16th National Congress and the Third Session of the 16th Congress of the Central Committee to seriously implement the central committee 's important policies and overall plans on this year 's work and to continue to push forward reforms and opening up as well as our modernization drive .
To have this year 's work well done , we must have a right understanding of the current situation to see both favorable conditions and new opportunities and unfavorable conditions and challenges , and to strengthen our senses of responsibility , urgency and hardship .
The three-party talks on the Iraqi issue were held on 19th at the UN 's headquarters in New York . UN Secretary General Annan held discussions with representatives from the Iraqi Temporary Governing Council and US-British allied forces authority , with the focus on how the UN should play its role in Iraq 's reconstruction .
The meeting discussed issues on Iraq 's politics , humanitarian , and appointment of a UN special envoy to Iraq . The three sides have candidly exchanged ideas on the issues .
As the US and Britain 's power transfer plan is facing oppositions , it will naturally attract attentions to whether and how the UN will interfere in Iraq 's reconstruction .
Since the US announced the end of major wars in Iraq in early May last year , Iraq has seen a continuous turbulent situation . Attacks against the occupation come one after another , resulting in heavy casualties and great chaos .
Although former Iraqi President Saddam was arrested on December 13 last year , the US has had little time to cheer because the security situation did not see any improvement and the occupation authority found itself bogged down in difficulties as opposition activities intensified .
On the other hand , the Iraqi people and Arab nations have called on foreign troops to withdraw from Iraq , hand over the power to the Iraqi people and let them rule their own country .
Meanwhile , the US and Britain are seeking to reconstruct the Iraqi regime according to their wills , on the basis of which they will gradually withdraw from the mire in a " decent " way .
Therefore , the way and process of power transfer have become the current focus of the Iraqi issue .
The power-transfer idea proposed by the US and British governing authority and the Iraqi Temporary Governing Council last November is as follows : a Iraq 's Transitional Government will be set up by July 1 via election by the " Transitional National Congress " , while the delegates attending the congress will be elected by the " Provincial Election Committee " .
However , the Shiite Muslims , which are the majority of the population , have stressed that a direct national election should be held to show a true and fair power transfer to Iraq .
US Secretary of State Powell 's recent visit to Russia still attracts much attention .
This is because , on one hand , US-Russian relations are very important and have far-reaching influence on today 's world .
More importantly , Powell 's visit to Moscow had substantial content and gave a clear signal that Russian-US relations had clouded over .
If the cloud is not cleared in time , the two countries ' ties will see a bleak prospect .
Although Washington and Moscow have an unblocked channel for dialogue , Powell still decided to expound his ideas in an article carried in Russia 's influential newspaper , the News .
Powell pointed out in the article that the US had been perplexed by a series of incidents in Russia 's domestic and diplomatic affairs over the past few months .
He believed that the Russian authority had not been completely checked by the law . Key factors in a citizenry society including press freedom , development of political parties are not firm enough .
Russia 's policies in Chechnya and its attitudes towards neighboring Commonwealth Independent States caused more concerns in the US .
In a diplomat 's view , making known one 's opinion through public media is the " last ditch " of communication .
The aim of the US choice gives much food for thought . It is obvious to see Russia 's embarrassment and displeasure over the issue .
After entering the new century , economic globalization has become a great and grim challenge facing African countries .
African leaders have come to realize more and more clearly that Africa can no longer afford to lose good opportunities and should seek ways to deal with the issue .
On July 9 , 2002 , the African Union officially began its operation . Since then , African countries , on one hand , have been actively promoting the " New Partnership for African Development Program " in an effort to develop the economy and change their unfavorable position in the economic globalization process ; on the other hand , they have made great efforts to remove major barrier to Africa 's great rejuvenation course -- armed conflicts -- to create a unified , peaceful and stable environment .
Currently , Africa 's overall situation has seen a trend of easing up , with hot issues obviously cooling down . All the countries have strengthened their sense of urgency to end armed conflicts .
With the full support of the UN and the international community , Africa 's influential regional organizations , big powers and famous politicians have all taken actions to aggrandize their efforts to settle regional conflicts and eliminate internal chaos . Some long lasting conflicts and chaos have almost been brought under control .
For example , a national unity government was formed in Congo ( Kinshasa ) last June ; Sao Tome and Principe settled a coup crisis through peaceful ways in July ; Liberian government and rebels reached peace agreement in the Ghanaian capital of Accra in August ; Sudanese government and southern rebels started key negotiations to break the impasse in peace process in September ; Somali 's various militia and political parties began peace talks in Kenya to discuss the national peace process in October ; Burundian government and rebels signed a peace agreement in November .
Of course , Africa 's current stable situation is still fragile and the fruit of peace needs to be consolidated while there are still some potential or current armed conflicts that need to be settled once and for all .
In the meantime , the speed of African countries ' economic development still lags far behind other developing countries in Asia and other regions . This is an unfavorable factor for Africa 's development .
The African people need to make long-term and arduous efforts to find ways to effectively deal with the challenges posed by the economic globalization and realize the dream of African rejuvenation .
Recently , parts of our country have been hit by the highly infectious bird flu epidemic .
The Party 's Central Committee and the State Council have paid high attention , quickly made a series of important decisions , and come up with clear and definite guidelines , policies and measures for the prevention work .
All regions and departments concerned have taken emergent actions to do their best to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the arrangement of the Party Central Committee and the State Council .
Currently , the prevention work of the bird flu is being carried out nationwide in an emergent but orderly way .
The highly infectious bird flu is a fast-spreading and seriously harmful animal disease that greatly endangers husbandry production and people 's health and safety .
To conscientiously do a good job in the prevention of the highly infectious bird flu concerns the masses ' health and safety , agricultural development and farmers ' income growth and overall economic development as well as social stability . All regions and departments must , under the guidance of the important ideas of the " Three Represents " and in accordance with the requirements set forth in the " Animal Quarantine Law of the People 's Republic of China " , strengthen leadership , provide close cooperation , depend on science , observe the laws in the prevention work , carry out the mass prevention work in a coordinated manner , take decisive measures and earnestly implement various preventive measures in the spirit of being highly responsible to the people , in order to win the war against the bird flu .
As the world 's largest debtor country , US is once again facing an increasing amount of foreign debt .
The US Treasure Department announced on January 16 that by the end of September , US debts owed to various foreign creditors had totaled $ 6.494 trillion , up 2.2 % from the previously announced figure .
On an average basis , each American has a foreign debt of over $ 20,000 .
Coincidently , one week ago , the International Monetary Fund issued a research report which harshly criticized and warned about the US unstable financial basis and pointed out that the record-setting US foreign debts had reached a level that might endanger the world financial stability .
Statistics showed that foreign private investors have controlled nearly 40 % of US government 's bonds .
This has reminded us that in the first half of the 20th century , Keynesian advised President Roosevelt to adopt a deficit policy to spur the economy while raising foreign loans to deal with the financial deficits .
The move has played an important role in accelerating the " effective demands " to settle the emergency of an economic crisis .
However , people have noticed that several previous US administrations have tended to regard it as a " panacea " .
However , since President Regan advocated a tax cut-off and military build-up in 1980s of the 20th century , US financial deficits have been on a gradual rise and it has eventually become the largest debtor country .
The commencement of the first round of six-party talks is an important step in the peaceful settlement process of the dialogue on the Korean Peninsula 's nuclear issue .
The common ground reached by various parties during this round of talks has laid an essential foundation for the talks to continue , and has further defined the targets , ways and policies to settle the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula .
Over the past few months , the parties concerned have insisted in peacefully resolving the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula through dialogue . On the basis of the first round of the six-party talks , all parties have conducted extensive coordination and discussions at different levels and have made unremitting efforts to begin the second round of talks in an early date .
Meanwhile , North Korea and the US have further shown their flexibility to some extent .
The preparation for the talks has made important progress so far . The success of the talks is the common hope of all parties .
What can be achieved in the second round of six-party talks and whether the talks will continue have attracted much attention from all parties concerned and the international community .
In this regard , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the target of the six-party talks is to maintain and push forward the process of a peaceful settlement through dialogues . We are willing to make concerted efforts with all parties concerned .
The Chinese side 's basic starting point is to safeguard peace and stability in the Korean Peninsular and realize the target of a nuclear-free peninsular .
The Chinese side holds that as long as the parties attending the meeting show sincerity , mutual respect and equality in the discussions , they can create favorable conditions to push forward the settlement of the relevant issues .
In late 1970s last century , the US-Libyan relations deteriorated . In 1981 , the two countries severed diplomatic ties .
US President Regan had presented a long list of crimes committed by Libyan leader Gaddafi , accusing Libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and conducting military interferences abroad as well as terrorism .
The two sides moved from the war of words to military actions . The US launched " Prairie Fire " and " El Dorado Canyon " , two surgical air attacks against Libya .
Later , the US imposed economic sanctions on Libya , attacking , containing and threatening the country in politics , diplomacy and military .
However , Gaddafi never gave up under heavy pressures .
Currently , the US-Libyan relations have warmed up . People have attributed this to the deterrent effect of the Iraqi war , which seems not right .
In fact , over the past years , Gaddafi , who has a unique character , has been resisting the US on one hand while showing the olive branch to the US on the other , but has failed to receive any response .
After the war in Iraq , the strategic adjustments made by various parties in the Middle East and restructuring of regional powers offered an opportunity for the resumption of US-Libyan diplomatic relations .
To Gaddafi , resuming friendly ties with the US will end sanctions , develop the economy , improve people 's well-being , get rid of the isolation and get integrated into the international community .
Abandoning things that it has so far failed to get and will not get for a short while , Libya will instead gain a completely new environment .
From February 7 to 8 , political figures from Europe , US and other parts of the world met in Munich , Germany , to attend the 40th Munich Security Policy Conference .
The so-called " Munich Security Policy Conference " was initiated by no-governmental individuals in Germany and is an international security forum sponsored by the German government . Over the past few years , it has been paid increasing attention to after the 9 / 11 in particular and is called the " Davos Forum " in the field of security .
One of the top agendas of the meeting is to discuss the cross-Atlantic relations .
Remarks made by European and US political figures during and after the meeting have shown that the two sides are trying hard to clear the shadow the Iraqi war has brought to their bilateral ties and are trying to go back on the track of cooperation .
Bertrams , Director of Berlin International and Security Affairs Research Institution , said this was a meeting to restore the European-US ties . Both sides had the willingness of going closer once again .
To the European-US relations , the new information from the meeting is that Europe and the US need to resume talks . They need to seriously consider the common missions facing the two sides and find out the convergence of interests to fulfill these common missions .
Compared with last year 's meeting , the smell of gunpowder has disappeared in this year 's meeting and the two sides ' standpoints are getting closer .
Although the " Old Europe " represented by France and Germany are still taking the Iraqi war to hearts , they have expressed the willingness to " look forward " .
German Foreign Minister Fischer said during the meeting : although we have different views towards the war , we must take joint actions to ensure the peace following the Iraqi war , so we must look forward .
He also said although Germany would not send troops to Iraq , it would not hinder NATO 's direct role in Iraq .
The United States , which has taken the initiative in modern media , has dominated most of international news coverage , with its media publicity reaching almost every corner of the world . Then why does it still make such a huge investment in setting up a special satellite TV station to cover 22 counties in the Middle East ?
Staff members in charge of the " Freedom-1 " TV station have been quoted as saying that it is to provide Arab nations a news platform with " comprehensive and just viewpoints " .
However , analysts have pointed out that " Freedom-1 " would become a US strategic weapon to infiltrate and invade Arab nations ' public opinions and cultures .
It seems that " Freedom-1 " has an extraordinary mission , which can be summed up as follows : First is to promote the " concept of freedom " .
The US believes that the Islamic civilization is a severe hindrance for the West to push forward modern civilization . The extremist religious forces in Islamic nations in the Middle East are a hotbed for international terrorism characterized as anti-US . To effectively crack down on terrorism , the Islamic world must be reformed to conform with and accept western values , life styles and political systems .
The US is attempting to use programs in the " Freedom-1 " to exert a subtle influence to instill its own ideology to the Arab people .
Second is to improve the US image .
The US is carrying out a unilateral foreign policy and dominating world affairs with its power . Its hegemonic acts have greatly angered the Arab and Islamic countries .
Following the " 9 / 11 " incident , the conflict between the US , who has been long siding with Israel , and the Islamic world in the Middle East has been intensified .
Under the name of eliminating weapons of mass destruction , the US invaded Iraq by force without solid evidence and UN authorization , which has aroused strong resentment among the Muslim people .
The talks between Pakistani and Indian officials were held from February 16 to 18 in Islamabad . The hope of peace has emerged once again in the subcontinent of South Asia .
The two countries ' officials have agreed on a timetable and forms of future talks and have established a mechanism for continuing talks , which symbolizes the resumption of Pakistani-Indian dialogue process that came to a standstill two years ago , and will lay a foundation for the two countries to gradually settle all standing issues including the conflict in Kashmir . It has shown the two sides ' valuable sincerity for peace .
Before the talks , most analysts held a cautious attitude towards the prospect of the peace process although the two countries ' ties had been warmed up by a series of bilateral goodwill moves .
It 's no wonder that nobody can be very certain that the sunshine on the negotiation table today will become flashes and thunders in border areas tomorrow if looking back to the violent ups and downs in Pakistani-Indian relations over the past few years .
However , when Pakistani Foreign Secretary Riaz Khokar read the two countries ' statement with a smile , the optimistic atmosphere spread out again , which has refreshed many who have long been watching the situation in South Asia .
Firstly , the timetable set during the meeting is very practical . The two sides have not only defined detailed negotiation timetable and topics , but also different levels of talks in accordance with the importance of the topics .
Secondly , the two sides have learnt lessons from the failure of direct talks between the two countries ' leaders during the Agra Summit Meeting in July 2001 and have agreed to hold talks in " steps " , which means the talks will go from lower to higher levels in order to make full preparation for the summit talks .
Thirdly , after the bilateral ties saw ups and downs , the two countries have agreed that war is not a good way to solve disputes and the two sides should stay away from wars . The agreement has laid a foundation for the two countries ' leaders to reach an understanding of " no more wars for Pakistan and India " .
To fully and correctly understand and implement the policy of " One Country , Two Systems " , we should integrate " One Country " and " Two Systems " with " Loving the Country " and " Loving Hong Kong " , integrate the respect to Hong Kong 's high autonomy with safeguarding the national sovereignty , and integrate Hong Kong 's maintaining capitalism with the nation 's main body 's sticking to socialism .
Only in this way can Hong Kong people 's well-being be safeguarded . And it is also in the long-term interests of all the people .
Since Hong Kong 's return , the central government has firmly implemented the policy of " One Country , Two Systems " and has acted strictly in accordance with the Basic Law .
The mass Hong Kong people have enjoyed the status of masters and unprecedented democratic rights .
With the great support of the central government and the mainland , Hong Kong has successfully dealt with various risks and challenges including the impact brought about by the Asian financial crisis , and remains the international financial , trade and shipping center .
Practices have proved that the policy of " One Country , Two Systems " has a strong vitality .
Today 's re-publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's remarks 20 years ago has shown the central government 's firm determination to implement the policy of " One Country , Two Systems " . It is to enable all the people to fully and correctly understand the policy and to push forward the great practice of " One Country , Two Systems " .
Today , the Party Central Committee and the State Council are here to hold a State Science and Technology Award meeting .
President Hu Jintao gave the top prizes of the 2003 State Science and Technology Awards to academicians Liu Dongsheng and Wang Yongzhi .
The meeting awarded prizes to the " China Manned Space Project " that has won the special prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award and science and technology workers who have won the 2003 State Science Award , the State Technical Renovation Award and the State Science and Technology Progress Award .
On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council , I 'd like to express my warm congratulations to all award winners .
To show the sincere regards and the highest respect to science and technology workers in all fields of the country .
For our country , the first 20 years of the century are an important strategic period that offers opportunities and must be tightly grasped to make great achievements .
We will be dedicated to the full construction of a better-off society in a higher level that is in the interests of over one billion people .
To better use this strategic period and try to make some achievement , we must attach greater importance to developing science and technology .
After the " 9 / 11 " incident , US President Bush dished out a strategy of " preemptive strike " in June 2002 and brought it into practice in US foreign policy . The US launched the first war of " preemptive strike " in Iraq last March .
The idea of " preemptive strike " is not only against the principles of international laws with " mutual respect to sovereignty and territorial integrity " as the core , but will inevitably result in the dangerous effect of imitation by others . New ups and downs will thus appear in the world order .
When the theory of " preemptive strike " was first raised , some US politicians asked the question : " What will we do if other countries follow the US ? "
As expected , over the past two years , more and more countries are claiming to launch " preemptive strike " . The squad advocating " preemptive strike " is getting bigger and bigger .
This is a new trend that is worth paying attention to and study .
Within the month when Bush proposed the strategy of " preemptive strike " , Australian Prime Minister Howard was the first to stand out to show his support .
He said that once it got hard evidence that terrorists would launch attacks against Australia , the country would take the " preemptive strike " strategy to launch military operations in neighboring countries .
He even proposed to add the principle of " preemptive strike " into the UN Charter , believing that it was necessary to amend the UN Charter to empower various states the right of taking " preemptive strike " to crack down on terrorists or nations supporting terrorism .
In northeastern Asia , the " Defense White Paper " issued by Japan 's Defense Agency in July 1999 proposed that Japan launch " preemptive strike " on foreign bases if facing missile attacks or military invasion .
Following the war in Iraq , Japan 's calls for the " preemptive strike " strategy are getting even louder .
Recently , there have been a lot of international comments on US ' policy towards Africa .
The US " Foreign Policy Focus " published in this January has carried an article titled " The 2004 African Policy Outlook " . The article says that over the past year , the Bush administration 's foreign policy has brought direct or indirect negative influences on Africa , especially the US dedication to the anti-terrorism war and the issue of proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction . The US cannot get away from Iraq , which has distracted its attention to Africa .
People still remember that to show his concern about Africa , the Bush administration has adopted a " President Helps AIDS Emergency Project " last January , promising to provide Africa at least $ 3 billion every year .
Last July , President Bush visited five African countries including Senegal , South Africa , Botswana , Uganda and Nigeria and promised to offer African countries $ 15 billion for the prevention and cure of AIDS and another $ 100 million for anti-terrorism in Africa . He also announced assistance programs in Africa including the food emergency assistance program and education assistance program .
These assistance programs were once well received in African countries and had won many praises from the international community .
However , one year has past and the US has not yet to take concrete actions .
Africa needs emergent assistance .
Entering the new century , Africa is facing various challenges in its development . It has established the " African Union " , which is responsible for coordinating African affairs , to implement " the Century Development Targets " set by the UN in 2000 and to make great efforts to reduce hunger and poverty and promote health and education . It has adopted " the New Partnership for African Development " to promote African countries ' development . However , due to its poor economic basis , it has been short of development funds .
The UN has called on the developed countries to divert 0.7 % of their total GDP to assist the least developed countries .
However , US official assistance only accounts for 0.1 % of its total GDP , far lower than the UN request , and it stands at the last position of the donors ' list .
A hot topic has been debated in Europe recently : whether the " Big Three " meeting of German Chancellor Schroeder , French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair is gradually moving towards a mechanism .
The public has called the " Big Three " of Germany , France and Britain Europe 's " New Troika " , with their relations called " New Triangle " ties .
The " New Triangle " is a new thing . Where will it lead to is yet to be observed but in any point of view , generally speaking , the " New Triangle " seems helpful to Europe 's integration process , so it can help Europe play an important role in the international arena as one part of the world 's multipolarizational structure .
Looking back to Europe 's history over the past 100 years , the German , French and British triangle ties are basically characterized by the British and French alliance containing or resisting Germany .
The two world wars are the proofs .
During the Cold War , East and West Germanys were respectively bound up into the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the NATO .
After the end of the Cold War , a unified Germany became stronger , which has led to the imbalance in the structure of Western Europe . France 's doubts have increased , resulting in the failure of the " Germany-France Axis " and Britain and France getting closer once again with the common aim of containing Germany .
However , with the re-start of the " Germany-France Axis " over the past years and fierce clashes between the unipolarization and multipolarization in the world , the EU has been split over the issue of Iraq .
The " Old Europe " represented by Germany and France and the " New Europe " represented by Britain and Poland took completely different stances on the issue of the Iraqi war .
And the split has come at a point when the EU is about to undergo its largest expansion in history .
Talking about Arab countries ' reforms recently in Cairo , Egyptian President Mubarak criticized the move by the outside world of imposing a single reform pattern on Arab nations and warned that this attempt would run counter to the desires and were not in the interests of the peace and stability in the Middle East region .
He believed that the reform measures should be in accordance with their own characteristics and abilities and that a single reform pattern was like turning a blind eye to different countries ' diverse cultural , social and religious characteristics .
He also pointed out that Arab countries welcomed outside help during the course of reform , but such efforts should be made on the basis of understanding the different conditions of various countries and respecting their wills , in order to promote the Arab countries ' reform process in the fields of politics , economy and culture .
The remarks made by the Egyptian leader have reflected the common views of Arab nations .
At present , under the pressure of anti-terrorism , anti-proliferation and democratic reforms , the Middle East has become one of the hot spots in the world . New instabilities are brewing and will lead to restructuring .
Following the two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , how will Iraq , which was regarded as one of the " Evil Axis " by the US in the past , undergo political reconstruction ?
How will various political systems and social patterns in the Middle East region change ?
These are questions concerning not only the Arab world and the international community , but the US and its western allies as well .
Following his meeting with Bahrain Crown Prince Salman on 9th in Washington D.C. , US Secretary of State Powell reiterated that the US would promote " western style democracy and capitalism plans " in the Middle East .
He also stressed : " We are considering what else we can do and how to systematize them . "
Last year was designated by the International Olympic Committee as the " Year of Culture and Education " .
The Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee took the favorable opportunity in holding a series of educational activities to promote advanced culture and spread Olympic knowledge .
Among them , the publication of the book of " Olympic Knowledge for Middle School Students " for young readers was a very important achievement .
The book , full of pictures and stories , introduces knowledge about the Olympic Games and the essence of the Olympic spirit through lively stories . It is a good textbook that helps young people to know more about the Olympic Games and arouses social enthusiasm for participating in the Olympic Games .
Last year , the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee specially designed a curriculum timetable with regenerated paper with Olympic emblems printed thereon .
The concept of " Green Olympics " is that the Olympic Games should be prepared and hosted under the guiding principles of environmental protection , ecological balance and other ideas of sustainable development .
We hope that these curriculum timetables will discipline students ' acts like setting the courses and make them to gradually become the practitioner and promoter of the " Green Olympics " .
Education is one of the key contents of the Olympic Games and a good demonstration of the " Human-Oriented Olympics " .
The true objective of the Olympic Games is to educate young people from a new angle and in a new way to promote young people 's physical and mental development in a harmonious way .
Therefore , the combination of sports and education will not only expand new grounds for the development of the education undertaking , but will make the Olympic Games more instructive as well .
" Green Olympics " is one of the three ideals of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing .
Its key content is to greatly improve the capital 's environmental quality to create a good environment for the Olympic Games and build an ecological city .
To this end , we must extensively use and adopt environmental technologies and measures , comprehensively promote large-scale environmental control work , beautify urban and rural environment and develop the environmental protection industry . We must also continue to arouse the public awareness of environmental protection and encourage the mass public to take part in various activities to improve the ecological environment .
To have the implementation work of " Green Olympics " well done is an important task in implementing the scientific view of people-oriented , comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development as proposed during the third session of the 16th Central Committee Congress of the Communist Party , and in promoting Beijing 's economic and social development in a comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable way .
We must make it a prior focus .
To achieve the target of " Green Olympics " , Beijing has prepared the " Olympics Action Plan " and the " Ecological and Environmental Protection Plan " on the basis of the " Tenth Five-Year Plan " and the " Bidding Report " , setting new targets and plans for the environmental construction and protection work in the next few years .
The target of hosting a green Olympic Games will be fully realized through taking steps as planned .
On February 25 , the US State Department issued the " 2003 State Human Rights Report " , finding faults with over 190 nations including China once again like a " teacher " . It said many countries ' human rights conditions were too poor or very poor to reach the American standard ; other countries had gone backwards in key areas of human rights .
Of course , there are still some countries that have seen great improvement in their human rights conditions . For example , Afghanistan and Iraq , but they are the " achievements " made by the US army after it overthrew the former regimes and " liberated " the two countries .
How about the human rights conditions in the US ?
Like the previous years , the report says nothing .
On March 1 , the Information Office of China 's State Council issued the " 2003 US Human Rights Records " to make up for the inadequacy of the US human rights report .
Based on a lot of evidences , the article introduces problems existing in US human rights and the US infringement on other countries ' human rights .
The American people have a historical tradition of sincerity and integrity and admitting mistakes when they have committed any .
The well-known story of George Washington who chopped a cherry tree when he was a child is a lively example .
Now the US has become the sole superpower in the world , but it has begun not to tell the truth .
Recently , silent changes are taking place in Japan 's mainstream media reports on China 's economic development .
Opposite to the previous " China Threat Theory " , many reports in Japan have begun to believe that China 's economic development has accelerated Japan 's economic recovery and a strong demand in the Chinese markets has become a great driving force of Japan 's economic development .
The US " Newsweek " has also carried an article recently , saying that the rise of China was an opportunity instead of a threat to other countries , its neighboring countries in particular .
The widespread " China Threat Theory " is being replaced by the " China Opportunity Theory " .
The " China Threat Theory " claimed that China 's development would pose threats to other countries , especially its neighbors .
However , the allegation with the aim of provocation has not been accepted by China 's neighboring countries .
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir once said frankly that " there is no need for Asian countries to be afraid of China 's increasingly strengthened military and economic power because China does not have a tradition of invading foreign countries . "
A prospect plan issued by the Indian Defense Ministry also believed that China posed no military threats to India .
In the area of economy and trade , various governments and enterprises have regarded China the best choice for them to expand their markets . Overseas investors with strategic visions have used their actions to write the " China Opportunity Theory " . Among the world 's top 500 enterprises , more than 400 have made investments in China .
China has been leading the world in attracting foreign investment for several years in a row .
GDP is a key macro economic indicator widely used in the world .
It is important to keep the growth of GDP during our country 's modernization drive .
We need to keep a fast economic growth momentum when taking consideration the fact alone that one percentage increase in GDP will result in more than 800,000 additional jobs .
To realize the great target of the full construction of a better-off society and the third-stage strategic goal in the modernization drive will , to a great extent , depend on a fast and sustainable growth of GDP .
However , we should notice that the GDP indicator has its defects .
For example , it is not easy to correctly reflect the quality and structure of economic growth and the level of people 's actual social welfare benefits . It also cannot correctly measure social distribution and justice .
On the other hand , GDP is also not the sole measurement .
When we review political achievements , we will not look at the GDP growth alone , instead we will also check out such aspects as people 's actual material and cultural life , the employment situation , social insurance , social justice , social order , social management and social harmony .
Therefore , we should look at the GDP calculation system in a scientific spirit and with scientific attitudes and views . GDP 's position in the overall economic and social development should be properly treated .
While it is necessary to keep a certain growth rate , we shall not lay too much emphasis on or unduly or painstakingly pursue growth rate .
Since the visit of a Security Council delegation to six countries in West Africa at the end of last June , inspiring changes have taken place in the overall situation in the region in spite of ups and downs in the situation in a small number of countries .
We are pleased to notice that the government troops in Sierra Leone are making positive progress in improving the army and the police 's capability , strengthening the control of the country 's diamond and preparing for local government elections . The UN Mission in Sierra Leone is also phasing out in accordance with plans set earlier .
It 's also pleasing that with the deployment of the UN Mission in Liberia , Liberia is gradually getting out the shadow following a long-standing war and is on a track of reconstruction .
The political process in Guinea-Bissau has also made positive progress . The transitional government has promised to hold legislative election in March this year .
After suffering some setbacks , the peace process in Ivory Coast has seen a turn for the better . All parties have promised to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement . The " New Forces " has announced to return to the national reconciliation government . The Security Council is discussing the issue of sending peacekeepers to the country .
We are expecting the Security Council to make a decision at an earlier possible date .
The Secretariat , the Economic Community of West African States and parties concerned , from a regional perspective , are also making great efforts to settle the issues concerning small weapons , mercenaries , child soldiers and cross border .
While fully affirming the above-mentioned progress , we should also note that the overall situation in West Africa is still weak . Due to geographic and historical reasons in particular , the countries in this region are closely connected , with the situation in one country having influence on another . Chaos in one country can usually spread to neighboring countries or even the entire region .
Therefore , as what the Security Council has suggested , the international community , including the Security Council , must stick to an comprehensive and overall strategy to deal with the issues in West Africa and make great efforts to settle the cross-border issues while taking active actions to help the relevant countries and regional and sub-regional organizations including the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to strengthen their capability of preventing and settling conflicts .
We have common understanding that children are the future of the world .
We are obliged to create the best and the most suitable conditions for them to live , study , grow up and achieve success .
However , it is regrettable that in today 's world , thousands of millions of children are still suffering from armed conflicts .
What they experience are chaos and backwardness . What they see are violence and destruction . What they suffer are harms and abuse . What they feel are grief and helplessness .
Therefore , it is the international community 's responsibility to protect the children from harms resulted from armed conflicts .
Every country , especially parties involved in conflicts , should make their greatest efforts to this end .
We are pleased to see that the UN has taken a series of measures to promote the protection of children in conflicts in recent years and has achieved positive results .
The Security Council has passed four resolutions numbered 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) and 1460 ( 2003 ) to provide an important framework for protecting children .
The UN peacekeeping forces in some regions have regarded the protection of children as one of their priorities . This includes the designation of child protection consultants . They have taken full consideration of the children 's needs while helping the countries with the programs of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration .
Some peace agreements pushed forward by the UN or with UN 's involvement also contain articles for child protection .
National reconciliation is an important condition for establishing long-term peace and stability in post-conflict regions .
After the end of a conflict , if the parties concerned cannot be reconciled with one another or fail to put an end to their feud , a peaceful situation cannot be truly maintained and the flames of conflicts may be rekindled .
In many cases , national reconciliation following clashes requires the concerted efforts of all parties concerned . It also needs the support and help from the international community , especially the UN .
For years , the UN has played a useful role in helping and promoting the national reconciliation process following conflicts in some countries and has gained a lot of experience . We believe that generally speaking , the UN must cope with the following three relationships in an effort to successfully help realize national reconciliation in post-conflict countries .
To give consideration to the relationship of both the short-term and long-term objectives .
National reconciliation usually needs a certain process and is hard to fulfill in just one step .
There should be different focuses in different phases .
To promote the national reconciliation , all former combatants should first be requested to " say goodbye " to their arms to create a secure environment .
During this phase , it is very important to make efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate the former combatants .
We are pleased to notice that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is stabilizing , the relationship between different ethnic groups is easing up , the economic reconstruction has begun to achieve fruitful results , the work of refugee repatriation has almost been accomplished and its ties with neighboring countries are steadily improving .
It has not been easy for the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina to make such progress , which is very pleasing .
I 'd like to congratulate the government and the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and express my heartfelt hope that all parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to make efforts and strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and push forward the peace process .
Meanwhile , we 've also noticed that Bosnia and Herzegovina 's national agencies and their capabilities still need to be improved . Reforms in the areas of justice and police , in particular , still face challenges .
We believe that it is proper for the high-ranking representative to make it a prior task for the first half of this year . We support the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina 's active cooperation with the work of the high-ranking representative .
We believe that with the help of the international community , the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina will continuously make new achievements in the drive of building their country and will take the road of independent development in an early date and reach the target of participating in the European integration .
The peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina are of great significance to the realization of a long-term peace and development in this region .
The Chinese side has been paying close attention to the development of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and will join hands with the international community to make its own contributions to helping Bosnia and Herzegovina to realize long-term peace and economic development .
China appreciates the efforts made by the Anti-terrorism Committee in promoting the implementation of Resolution No. 1373 ( 2001 ) in various countries and helping the developing countries to strengthen their anti-terrorism capability , and supports the Anti-terrorism Committee in strengthening coordination and cooperation with relevant international , regional and sub-regional organizations .
Meanwhile , we hope the Anti-terrorism Committee will strengthen its work on anti-terrorism assistance and try to satisfy the actual needs of the developing countries .
Currently , the issue of promoting the Anti-terrorism Committee has attracted much attention from many member states .
Following rounds of negotiations , the Anti-terrorism Committee has raised a formal report and has had it circulated as a Security Council document .
Following two years of practice , the current structure and operational mode of the Anti-terrorism Committee have appeared defective . For example , the member states have too much of a reporting burden ; there are a lot of meetings and documents ; work efficiency needs further improvement ; and there is a lack of sufficient coordination among experts .
Therefore , we fully support necessary reforms of the Anti-terrorism Committee . We support a package of schemes proposed in the report , including the establishment of the Executive Council of the Anti-terrorism Committee . We also hope that the existing problems will be settled as soon as possible , especially the issue of heavy reporting burden on its member states .
Here , what I 'd like to stress is that promotion and reform are a continuous process . No matter how reforms are carried out , the Anti-terrorism Committee should offer policy guidelines to the Executive Council . All decisions should be made by consultation and mutual agreement at the General Session of the Anti-terrorism Committee .
In recent years , the issue of small arms has always been a focus of close attention from the international community .
This shows that all parties have increasingly realized that the excessive accumulation and illegal sales of small arms will do harms to the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in relevant regions and countries .
It 's great relief that the UN has taken a series of effective actions to deal with the problem .
In 2001 , the " Firearms Protocol " annexed to the " UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime " and UN small arms " Action Plans " were reached one after another .
They have offered a legal and policy basis for properly dealing with the issue of small arms . It has shown the international community 's determination to crack down on the illegal trade of small arms .
Over the past three years , the international community has made great progress in promoting the effectiveness of the " Firearms Protocol " and the implementation of the " Action Plan " . The success of the first UN biennial conference on small arms in 2003 , in particular , has injected new momentum to the continuous and full implementation of the " Action Plan " .
Resolution No. 58 / 241 adopted in this General Assembly has decided to form a working team to hold negotiations regarding an international document on recognizing and tracking illegal small arms , which will surely further promote the international efforts to crack down on the illegal trade of small arms .
Likewise , the Security Council has paid increasing attention to the issue of small arms . It has held several special discussions and has passed relevant President Declarations and Resolutions .
In addition to this , the Security Council has stressed the importance of the issue of small arms when discussing a series of issues concerning the protection of civilians , women and children in conflicts .
Economic development and poverty elimination are the basic prerequisites for achieving sustainable development .
Sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and overall social development .
Without addressing the issue of living , development is out of the question , let alone any sustainable development .
Accelerating economic development and making great efforts to eliminate poverty are the only ways for developing countries to move towards sustainable development .
Without addressing of the issue of poverty in developing countries , the development in developed countries will also be hard to sustain .
Proper use of resources and protection of the environment are a must for realizing sustainable development .
Development could not be sustained at the cost of wasting resources and damaging the environment .
Natural resources are not inexhaustible , but mankind 's demand for social development keeping rising . If the relationship of the two cannot be properly handled , it will lead to a deterioration of the environment and will pose great threats to the existence and development of mankind .
Only by sticking to the road of a recycled economy based on the most efficient use of resources and environmental protection , can a sustainable development be realized .
The overall social progress and improvement of people 's living standard and quality are the ultimate objectives of sustainable development .
One year ago , the 9th APEC Leaders ' Informal Summit Meeting was held by the Huangpu River in Shanghai . The scenes of the meeting still leap before my eyes .
Today , we are meeting in the picturesque Los Cabos , which is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean , to discuss the great plans for the Asian Pacific economic cooperation .
We feel very happy to see old friends .
I 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to President Fox 's warm invitation and the Mexican government 's delicate arrangements .
Over the past year , the trend of economic globalization continues . The fast changing scientific and technological progress have brought new development opportunities to various countries .
Meanwhile , uncertainties in the global economic development are increasing . Some countries and regions , including relevant APEC member states , are facing new challenges in their economic development .
Trade protectionism is on the rise . The realization of a free , fair and just trade still has a long way to go .
The fight against terrorism is an arduous and complicated one . Untraditional security factors are increasing .
Our world is still full of instabilities .
Although the world is still facing various kinds of problems and will encounter various unexpected ones , the trend of peace and development of the age is irreversible and the aspiration of people in various countries for a good life has not changed .
This dialogue meeting carrying the theme of development is of great significance .
Development is the basis for progress of human civilization and the key for settling various conflicts and problems facing the world .
Only by achieving coordinated , balanced and common development of the whole world , can the world 's long-term peace and stability be realized .
We should hold thorough discussions on this topic and make concerted efforts to settle it .
The accelerated development of economic globalization has become the most striking characteristic of today 's world economy .
Pushed by the trend of economic globalization , ties between various countries and regions are getting increasingly closer . Markets are more open . The flow of funds , technology and talents are more extensive and faster . All of these have brought unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and pushing forward common development .
Meanwhile , the trend of economic globalization has also brought about grim challenges . The gap between the South and the North is enlarging . Some developing countries are facing the danger of being marginalized . The economic and financial risks are increasing . Cross-border crimes are serious . All of these have also made it urgent to carry out international cooperation to jointly deal with the challenges .
At the moment when opportunities and challenges co-exist , we should seize the opportunities and deal with the challenges , seek common grounds while reserving differences , and push forward the economic globalization in a direction toward common development and prosperity .
( International ) Flu Spread Peaks in the United States
Xinhua News Agency report of December 31 from Los Angeles ( by staff reporter Yan Liang ) - The US Disease Control and Prevention Center said on 31st that the most serious flu epidemic in 30 years in the United States had reached its peak , with 45 of US ' 50 states reporting the wide spread of the flu and the deaths caused by the flu increasing rapidly .

At least 42 children have died from the flu across the US . Adult deaths are also rising rapidly but so far no exact statistics are available .
Experts have attributed the serious spread of the flu in 2003 to two reasons : firstly , the flu was not of " Panama A " type , which couldn 't be prevented by the vaccine produced previously ; secondly , since there was a surplus of vaccine last year , the two major vaccine suppliers had reduced their production to 83 million units , causing a shortage of vaccine supply this year .
Although an average of 36,000 people die from flu and 114,000 others are hospitalized every year in the United States , the social panic caused by the spread of the flu this time was rarely seen before .
US epidemic disease expert , William Thompson , said that the flu was the most serious in 30 years in the United States and it came earlier than before , which had widely spread in many schools . Long queues were seen where vaccine injections are offered .
Facing the serious situation , the US Health Department has opened an emergency center and dispatched medical expert teams to all the states .

Xinhua News Agency report of January 6 from New York ( by staff reporter Xue Yanping ) - A report issued on 6th by a US prominent research institution , the Association of Supply Administration , showed that the US service industry index declined in December last year , which demonstrated that the service industry 's current growth still lagged behind that of the manufacturing industry .

( International ) US Dollar Sees Big Slump Again
Xinhua News Agency report of January 8 from New York - US dollar on 8th saw a big slump once again shortly after a brief rise on 7th influenced by remarks made by President of the European Central Bank .
President of the European Central Bank , Jean-Claude Trichet , said in a comment that a strong Euro had a negative impact on European firms ' exports , but he said that the world economic recovery and a stronger consumption demand had partly offset the impact brought about by a rising Euro .
He also pointed out that a strong Euro could to some extent play a role of stabilizing the prices in the Euro region , so the European Central Bank had decided to maintain the original rate of interest .
As investors saw the remarks as a sign that officials in the Euro region are not worried about a rising Euro , they sold out US dollars , leading to a decline of the dollar against major western currencies , with the British Pound hitting a new high against the US dollar in 11 years .
In the closing session at the New York Foreign Exchange market on 8th , the Euro rose against US dollar from 1 : 1.2640 the day before to 1 : 1.2761 ; the Pound rose against US dollar from 1 : 1.8180 to 1 : 1.8320 , once hitting 1 : 1.8354 during the session ; US dollar saw a decline against the Japanese Yen from 1 : 106.27 to 1 : 106.17 ; the dollar declined against Swiss Francs from 1 : 1.2398 to 1 : 1.2267 .

( Archaeological Discoveries ) 31 Qin Tombs Discovered in Fengxiang County , Shaanxi
Xinhua News Agency report of January 15 from Xi 'an ( by staff reporter Tie Ma ) - It has always been believed in the archaeological circle that the palace zone in Sunjianantou Village , Fengxiang County in Baoji city of Shaanxi Province , became the place for holding important royal sacrificial activities only after the Qin people moved their capital to Yongcheng . However , with the recent unexpected discovery of 31 Qin tombs within the palace zone , this long-standing argument is expected to change .
To make way for a company in Baoji city to build a factory on the historical site , the Archaeological Research Institute of Shaanxi Province carried out archaeological excavation work on the site . A total of 31 tombs dated back to Western Zhou Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period were discovered in an area of nearly 20,000 square meters , which would soon be taken over for use .
The archaeological team from Yongcheng , Shaanxi Province , excavated a total of 40 pieces of antiques including bronze and pottery wares from these tombs .
Among them was a Qin tomb , which had a big coffin with two coffins inside . There was a sacrificial tomb for two horses near the tomb .
Fifteen bronze and pottery wares were excavated from the tomb . The bronze wares included pots , basins and axes .
The bronze pots , delicately made and beautifully designed , bear a style of bronze ware making techniques of Western Zhou Dynasty .
Judging from the sacrificial objects in the tomb , the owner of the tomb could be a Qin noble in the late Western Zhou Dynasty .
Experts have thus predicted that there should be a large group of tombs nearby .
The unexpected discovery has offered valuable archeological references in the research of the move of Qin Dynasty capital and the layout of Yongcheng during Qin and Han Dynasties .
Tian Yaqi , deputy researcher of the Archaeological Research Institute of Shaanxi Province and head of the excavation team , said that in the past the archaeological circle had always believed that the palace zone in Sunjianantou Village became the place for holding important royal sacrificial activities from Qin to Western Han dynasties only after the Qin people moved their capital to Yongcheng .
However , the findings this time showed that this place was a city of Western Zhou Dynasty and had experienced prosperity several times long before the capital was moved to Yongcheng .

( International ) Arab League Secretary-General Calls on US Not to Impose " Democracy " on Middle East
Xinhua News Agency report of January 21 from Geneva - Secretary-General of the League of Arab States ( the Arab League ) , Moussa , on 21st called on the United States to discuss democracy with Arab countries instead of imposing democracy on the Middle East region .
Speaking in an interview during the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos , Switzerland , Moussa said : " If they ( American people ) want to realize democracy in the Middle East , they 'd better keep their promise to bring democracy to Iraq first . "
He said that the Arab League was America 's best partner to discuss democratic reform in the Middle East .
" Once you raise your point of view and are willing to listen to our views , we can talk about any ideas . "
" We don 't oppose democracy but democracy is not an action or order for immediate execution . "
Moussa pointed out that the US government had so far failed to convince people that the occupation of Iraq would bring " democracy " to the country .
" They said that they went to Iraq to show us a democratic model to follow . "
" But so far , we haven 't seen anything . "
Total Revenue of China 's Tourism Industry Predicted to Reach 487.4 Billion Yuan in 2003
Xinhua News Agency report of January 22 from Beijing ( by staff reporter Sun Yubo ) - The total domestic and international revenue of China 's tourism industry was estimated to reach 487.4 billion Yuan in 2003 , down 12.4 % from the year before , but the performance was still better than expected .
Statistics from the National Tourism Administration showed that in 2003 , entry visitors reached 91 million , including 11.3 million foreign visitors and 32.7 million entry overnight visitors , with tourism foreign exchange revenue topping 17.3 billion US dollars .
Domestic tourists reached 870 million , generating a domestic tourism revenue of 344.2 billion Yuan , down 0.9 % and 11.2 % respectively from the year before .
Officials of the National Tourism Administration said that in 2004 the whole tourism industry would go for an all-round recovery in the entry tourism sector while continuing to promote the development of the domestic tourism market and deepening the overhaul of the tourism market .
Meanwhile , it would do its best to present the yearly theme of " Tour of Common People 's Life " , around which a number of new tourism products would be designed and launched to reflect the life of ordinary Chinese people .
( International ) Economists Predict US to Be the Biggest Winner of Dollar Devaluation
Xinhua News Agency report of January 23 from Davos , Switzerland ( by staff reporters Li Jie and Ding Xigang ) - Discussions on the devaluation trend of US dollars were held on 23rd at the ongoing 34th World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos , Switzerland . Some experts predicted that the United States would be the biggest winner of the continuous decline of the dollar .
Most of the economists attending the meeting held that US officials , including US Treasure Secretary John Snow , seemed to have given up the " strong US dollar policy " , which had been in place in recent years .
The decline of the US dollar would provide the United States larger economic development space and more job opportunities , which was extremely obvious in the manufacturing sector .
Meanwhile , the decline of the US dollar had made American products more competitive in both domestic and international markets , which could help the US make up for its trade deficits .
However , experts said that a weak US dollar would also have negative impact on the United States .
Firstly , the US stock markets would probably remain sluggish with all investment value declining and foreign investors withdrawing investment for fear of a further decline of US dollars ; secondly , the soaring prices of imported products would eventually lead to deterioration of American people 's living standards ; thirdly , a marginal decline of US dollars might cause unrest in trade and finance sectors .
However , the devaluation of US dollars would do even greater harm to Europe , Japan and Canada .
Following the decline of the US dollar , pressures had mounted on Europe 's exports , which had confronted the European economy with a danger of all-round decline .
China to Speed Up Development of Electronic Products for Vehicle , Health Care and Other Application Sectors
Xinhua News Agency report of January 26 from Beijing ( by staff reporter Feng Xiaofang ) - China will speed up the development of various kinds of applied electronic products in vehicles , machine tools , transportation and health care to expand the development space of electronic information industry as well as to satisfy the needs of all walks of life .
Officials from the Information Industry Ministry said that the reform and upgrade of traditional enterprises were one of the key issues in the promotion of information technology .
Promoting the application of information technology in all walks of life was not only required for reforming and upgrading traditional industries , but would provide rare development opportunities for the electronic information industry as well .
According to the officials , while the development space of electronic information industry needs to be expanded to satisfy the needs of all trades , it is necessary to support the establishment of public technological service systems , to render support to strong research and development companies , and to offer technological support and guarantee for the application of information technology in key industries through provision of technological standards and testing environment , etc .
Meanwhile , it is necessary to develop businesses like technological services , administration consultancy and system integration and to support a batch of service providers such as system integration providers and application service providers , in a bid to promote the development of the brand-new information services .
( International ) Japanese Import and Export Trade Volume Both Hit New High in 2003
Xinhua News Agency report of January 26 from Tokyo ( by staff reporter Le Shaoyan ) - Statistics issued by the Japanese Finance Ministry on 26th showed that Japanese import and export trade volume both hit a historical new high in 2003 , with trade surplus once again surpassing 10 trillion Japanese Yen after three years .
In export , Japanese exports to the United States last year decreased by 9.8 % compared with that of the year before , but its exports to Asia saw a big increase of 12.9 % .
This has not only made up for Japan 's export decrease to the United States , but also pushed Japan 's total export volume last year up 4.7 % from the previous year to a record high of 54.5589 trillion Japanese Yen .
In import , due to the rising demand for energy resources such as oil and natural gas and their soaring prices , Japan 's total import volume in 2003 went up 5 % from the previous year to reach 44.3202 trillion Japanese Yen , also a record high .
In 2003 , Japan 's trade surplus topped 10.2387 trillion Japanese Yen , up 3.6 % from the previous year , hitting 10 trillion Japanese Yen once again after 3 years .
Private Enterprises Outnumber State-Owned / Controlled Enterprises in Guangdong for the First Time
Xinhua News Agency report of January 26 from Guangzhou ( by Chen Ji and Hu Yanni ) - Sources from the Guangdong Administration of Industry and Commerce said that in 2003 the number of Guangdong 's private firms , for the first time , surpassed that of state-owned firms or firms with the majority of shares controlled by the state , and that domestic enterprises had been effectively reshuffled .
According to statistics , by the end of 2003 the whole province had 690,000 various kinds of enterprises ( including domestic , private and foreign investment firms ) , up 0.59 % from the end of the year before .
This included 316,000 domestic firms , down 16.4 % from the end of the previous year , with a registered capital of 1,190.27 billion Yuan , up 0.9 % ; 323,000 private firms , with a registered capital of 452.28 billion Yuan , up 24.9 % and 33.85 respectively ; 52,000 foreign investment enterprises , with a registered capital of 140.5 billion US Dollars , up 3.6 % and 4.1 % respectively .
Private enterprises outnumbered state-owned or controlled enterprises for the first time .
Although the number of State-owned or controlled enterprises decreased during their structural reshuffle , their strength was boosted , with the average registered capital of each enterprise reaching 3.76 million Yuan , up 20 % compared with that at the end of 2002 .
According to statistics , in 2003 , a total number of 105,000 enterprises were newly registered all over the province , with one statistic number going down and the other two up .
They included 17,000 domestic firms , down 17.6 % from the corresponding period of the previous year ; 81,600 private firms and 6,561 foreign investment firms , up 29 % and 0.08 % respectively from the corresponding period of the previous year .
Of the newly registered firms , the respective proportions of domestic , private and foreign investment firms were 16 : 78 : 6 .
( International ) WTO Brings the " Byrd Subsidy " Dispute to Arbitration
Xinhua News Agency report of January 26 from Geneva ( by staff reporter Li Jie ) - The World Trade Organization announced on 26th that the lawsuit filed by the European Union and other seven WTO member states to impose sanctions against the US ' implementation of the " Byrd Subsidy " had been transferred to arbitration authority .
The lawsuit seeking for sanctions was raised following the US failure to abolish the Byrd Amendment before a deadline set by the WTO .
US Congress passed the Byrd Amendment in 2000 , requiring the US government to subsidize profit-losing US companies with revenues levied from anti-dumping and anti-subsidy punitive duties , instead of turning over it to the US Department of Treasury .
The US move has drawn opposition from its major trade partners , including the EU and Japan .
The WTO issued a final ruling in January 2003 that the amendment went against world trade rules and asked the United States to abolish it before December 27th that year .
However , the United States did not follow the WTO ruling .
The EU , Japan , Canada , Brazil , India , South Korea , Mexico and Chile recently filed an application to the WTO to seek additional levies on some of the US products equivalent to the subsidies distributed by the US government .
However , the United States had raised questions about the level of the sanction and the legality of the lawsuit .
( Hong Kong , Macao and Taiwan ) Hong Kong 's Retail Sales Up 10 % During Spring Festival
Xinhua News Agency report of January 28 from Hong Kong - The Association of Retail Industry Administration of Hong Kong disclosed that Hong Kong 's retail industry saw a booming business during the Lunar New Year . The industry said that its average sales volume rose 10 % , with some shops seeing 20-30 % rises .
Chairman of the Association of Retail Industry Administration of Hong Kong , Yu Pengchun , said recently that tourists from the mainland had driven the consumers ' sector in Hong Kong , and that Hong Kong 's retail industry saw a booming business during this Spring Festival , with some sectors such as jewelry and garments recording a sales growth of 20-30 % . The expenditure of mainland tourists accounts for 10 % of the total business turnover .
He said that the use of RMB credit cards by mainland tourists in Hong Kong had significantly stimulated the market during the Spring Festival , with the per settlement average reaching 3,000 Yuan , and some individual mainland tourists spending as much as 10,000 Yuan .
Influenced by last year 's SARS epidemic , the total turnover of Hong Kong 's retail industry fell 4 % .
Yu Pengchun estimated that with the economic recovery the total turnover of Hong Kong 's retail industry would see a one-digit increase this year , but the prices of the consumer goods would also be pressured to go up due to the rising costs .
He believed that deflation in Hong Kong would turn better this year .
( International ) Denmark Presents New Act to Restrict Immigration
Xinhua News Agency report of January 28 from Copenhagen - The Danish government presented a new act to restrict immigration to the parliament on 28th .
Under the act , children born of foreigners in Denmark will no longer have the right of automatically being granted citizenship .
The act is the latest of a series of measures to restrict immigration since the Danish Liberal Party leader Rasmussen became Prime Minister in November 2001 .
Reports say the act is most likely to be endorsed by the parliament as the Liberal Party has won the support from the right-wing Danish People 's Party on the immigration issue .
The act requires that children born of foreigners in Denmark apply for citizenship as required for other immigrants when coming of age , instead of being automatically permitted citizenship .
Citizenship of immigrants will be deprived of if they commit serious criminal crimes against society .
Over the past two years , the Danish government has brought about a series of restrict measures against immigrants in granting long-term residence permits to them and restricting their family members to enter Denmark .
Due to Danish government 's unfriendly policy towards immigrants , the number of foreigners taking refugees in Denmark has fallen from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
This has damaged Denmark 's long-standing image as a free country that cherishes human rights .
The achievements that Singapore has made cannot be regarded as a matter of course .
Even with advanced science and technology , I still don 't believe that people can maintain an ideal environment of higher living standard and quality , full employment and increasing salaries without making arduous efforts , maintaining social orders and adapting to changes .
These good things cannot be obtained automatically .
Only if all the people know that they must lay greater emphasis on the public interests and make difficult compromises and necessary adjustments , can all the people have a better future .
What will Singapore look like in 10 or 20 years ?
All of us wish to be able to tell the future , but the future is unpredictable .
Many factors are out of the control of Singapore .
The development of many things depends on the development of the world 's situation .
We don 't know when problems will crop up . In many occasions , this is a matter of luck .
For example , three Singaporeans went to Hong Kong for a visit and were infected with the SARS virus . This was just unpredictable .
In less than one month after the Spring Festival , three extraordinary safety accidents have already taken place in China , killing dozens of people .
People cannot help heaving a sigh at such frequent accidents with heavy losses of lives .
Several months before , the gas pipeline spurting accident in Chongqing , the gas explosions in several coal mines and the frequent serious traffic accidents had already killed hundreds of people .
China covers a large area and has a dense population . The chances of tragedies are more than other countries . It is quite common that dozens or hundreds of people die in accidents , which is an objective and helpless reality .
However , in the perspective of common sense , the occurrence of fatal accidents in China is still too frequent .
Among the numerous tragedies , fires , coal mine explosions , firework factory explosions and traffic accidents top the list .
This at least shows that the most lax measures have been adopted in these areas and people haven 't learnt from previous tragedies , resulting in reoccurrence of the same kind of accidents .
In the past when Singapore was undergoing fast economic growth , there also occurred serious fire accidents . The painful memory still lingers around today .
China is now within the same special period that sees fast economic growth and social transformation .
The accidents of local foreign housemaids ' falling down buildings are heard occasionally . Although the number is not high in proportion but taking into consideration of the relatively safe environment for housemaids , the frequent fall-down accidents don 't conform to the job 's low casualty feature .
According to statistics , from January 1999 to June 2003 , a total of 99 housemaids of various nationalities died after accidentally falling down from buildings .
Behind these numbers are many broken families that will never see their daughters and mothers back and one after another tragedy that should have been avoided . This also shows us the direction toward which we must do our best to reduce the tragic numbers to the lowest .
According to a recent statement issued by the Indonesian embassy , since 1999 , 96 Indonesian housemaids have died while working in Singapore , some of whom died after falling down from high-rise buildings .
In response to housemaids ' fall-down accidents , the Indonesian government has expressed their dissatisfaction occasionally and has made new regulations several times to strictly control the quality of local Indonesian housemaids in order to ensure their safety . However , the issue has not been settled . Bilateral relations between Singapore and Indonesia have been troubled inevitably by the issue of housemaids .
What confuses people most is that the number of housemaids ' fall-down accidents is even higher than the death toll of foreign workers in construction sites , which cannot but arouse people 's deep thoughts . And it is necessary to explore the background and the cause .
Chen Kongli , the world renowned Taiwan issue expert from the Chinese mainland , has recently published a new book , " Observing Taiwan " .
Most of the articles in the book were written during the period from Taiwan 's first party rotation in March 2000 to Chen Shui-bian 's proposing the theory of " One State in Each Side " . It is the writer 's observation and thoughts about Taiwan 's internal situation and the cross-strait relations during the period of " listening to its words and watching its actions " .
The book written two years ago was finally published two years later , which shows that the censor process of thesis concerning Taiwan is very complicated and very long in the mainland , and also shows that the publication of " Observing Taiwan " did not come out easily .
For a long time , when observing and studying the Taiwan issue , Chen Kongku has been seeking the truth and very pragmatic , not bound by political restrictions and has been exploring the preeminent truth and deep insight .
After reading this book , this feature will leave people deeper impression .
Since the early 1980s in the last century , the research on Taiwan issue has become the mainland 's " major study " . Many research institutions have sprung up with various kinds of scholars and experts emerging and showing their talents .
Overseas people have generally divided mainland 's Taiwan research agencies into the North and the South branches .
The North branch 's stance is relatively close to the government with tough opinions . It appeared more hawkish during certain historical periods or in the development course of some important political incidents .
The South branch of Taiwan research institutions is generally distributed south of the Yangtze River , including places such as Shanghai and Fujian .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has been reported by the Japanese media as telling lies about his " academic credential " of " studying in London for two years " .
Japan 's " Post Weekly " has received confirmation from the Dean 's Office of London University that during his 9-month stay in London , Koizumi only attended several courses irregularly and didn 't get any degree .
The scandal has been widely reported in the Chinese media and has afforded general satisfaction .
Indeed , a head of state would go so far as to fabricate the academic credential to deceive his own people .
This is especially shameful because it happened in the " imperialist " Japan .
However , if we look from another perspective , we may also see some positives from the scandal .
In addition , this is exactly what we lack and what we need to improve .
We have been advocating " integrity " in recent years to " build a sunshine government " , to respect the public 's " information rights " and to improve the administrative " transparency " . However , the reality is far from the aspiration .
Think about it . A " fake " academic credential of a country 's prime minister is , in fact , not something very big , but it was exposed by the media and fiercely attacked .
In such a country , what else cannot be put under the " sunshine " ?
At Taiwan 's electoral promotion parties , all groups will use buses to move the masses to the sites . However , the recent situation is the parties of Bian-Lu are obviously more desolate than those of Lian-Song .
Not long ago , at a promotion party in somewhere in the north , when Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian shouted loudly " Dongsuan ( elected ) " , half of the participants didn 't follow him unexpectedly . It turned out later that many of the local people have relatives or friends who are making investments in the mainland . The continuous postponement of the three direct links and the poor performance of the financial policies have upset many people .
If nothing unexpected happens , in the countdown of Taiwan 's presidential election , the pair of Chen-Lu is presumed to be defeated , as signs in the public polls and underground gambles have shown .
Unless more exciting scenarios appear , for example , the Pan-Blue Camp is split or more embarrassing scandals come out , Chen Shui-bian , who overtook the power with the support of Lee Teng-hui , has already proved that he has failed to win people 's hearts over the past four years and has weakened his supporters ' confidence following the Green Camp 's various financial scandals and low taste roles and performances being exposed to the public .
Facing the Blue Camp , who is likely to resume the ruling power , how should Beijing look at the issue ?
The first thing that should be understood is the Blue Camp , which is likely to take over power again , is already not the Nationalist Party but a combination of the Blue and the Orange , and the issue is whether the traditional party will join hands with the local party .
The close cooperation during the election campaign cannot be seen as a logical relationship in the future .
If there is a hope of being elected , it will spend a lot of time to make internal restructuring . The following legislative election at the end of the year will also prevent the Lian-Song administration from making too great changes in the cross-strait relations .
Unless it realizes that the improvement of cross-strait ties will add points to Taiwan 's internal politics and it is confident that it will make achievements in a short period of time . And the most important thing is to let the mass public to see the achievement .
Under such circumstances , Beijing should slow down its moves to promote the unification and give more time to Lian-Song , a pair of " traditional Blue Camp " leaders , to consolidate their internal situation .
Over half a century has passed since the US carried out its first nuclear explosion in New Mexico in July 1945 and dropped two nuclear bombs in Japan in August the same year .
Although nuclear weapons accumulated during the armament race of the US and the Soviet Union are enough to destruct the whole world , it is a relief that both sides had realized the danger of nuclear wars and prevented from pressing the nuclear buttons .
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the world has entered the era of post-Cold War . The danger of large-scale nuclear wars has basically been eliminated .
But at the same time , the danger of nuclear proliferation has not decreased but increased instead .
This kind of proliferation shows up in two areas .
The first is that some medium or larger-sized countries with substantial resources and strength are seeking various ways to produce and own nuclear weapons in an effort to gain domination in a region , resist neighboring countries , safeguard security or carry out blackmail diplomacy .
The second is that some non-state organizations , especially the Islamic extremist groups that harbor strong hatred against the western world , are doing their best to seek small nuclear weapons to launch bloody terrorist attacks against the West at the cost of a large number of innocent people .
With this kind of demand , middlemen , who are engaged in relevant technological transfer and sales , and the " nuclear black markets " have come into being . With their scales getting increasingly larger , they have become one of the important components of the proliferation in today 's world .
As one of the descendants of the Chinese people living in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area , the past scenes of the countryside and farmers ' life south of the Yangtze River are still in my memory now .
When returning home after years of departure , I found the green fields along the Hu-Hang Expressway were dotted with three-story buildings built by the farmers themselves , but few people were working in the fields .
It surprised me very much that such great changes have taken place in my homeland and with my fellow countrymen .
However , I was shocked recently to see some reportage and experts ' on-the-spot investigations regarding the situation in China 's rural areas on the Internet .
It 's hard to believe that such unimaginable dark sides still exist in China 's rural areas and the Chinese farmers are still living such humiliated and hard lives without any rights .
The lengthy " China Rural Area Investigation " , written by Chen Guili and his wife after they conducted on-the-spot investigations in rural areas in Anhui , Henan and Hebei provinces , has spoken out for the farmers and has shocked the Chinese society .
They have drawn a conclusion from a large number of facts that farmers are squeezed or even killed by corrupt officials : " Getting closer to the Chinese farmers , we have felt unprecedented shock and grievance . We have seen poverty , sins , helplessness , resistance , silence and grief that one can hardly imagine " .
These are really the most touching words .
As expected , Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday . A new election will be held in the near future .
To Abdullah , the election is of great importance in his political career while it has the same symbolic meaning to Malaysia 's political situation and its development .
It has only been four months since Abdullah took over from Mahathir last November .
Despite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold an earlier election .
This , at least , has two implications : firstly , Abdullah has been satisfied with his administrative performance over the past four months and has much confidence in the voters ' intentions ; secondly , he expects to consolidate his power basis through this way to shake off the shadow left by Mahathir .
There is no doubt that Abdullah 's decision to hold a blitz election has shown that he has made an overall appraisal of the domestic political situation .
Malaysia is seeing a good economic performance now and there are no topics for the opposition parties to make use of .
In addition to this , since Abdullah came into office , he has taken some very transparent anti-graft measures , including the arrest and prosecution of former Lands and Cooperative Development Minister Kasitah Gaddam , which has been welcomed and aroused the public optimism about future anti-corruption operations .
Meanwhile , he has called to improve the efficiency of public services , which is also an inspiring move .
Since the first day of its birth , the EU 's growth and the formation of its patterns have been greatly influenced by France 's politics and culture .
It is the EU 's foreign policy direction to struggle for independence in diplomacy and to seek attitudes and ways to deal with world affairs different from the US , from which the influence of France can be seen .
It is because of this that the international community , including China , Russia and Arab countries , all expect to see the EU to rise as a completely independent force in international relations .
We must admit that since late 1980s , the EU has been moving towards this direction in diplomacy .
In December 1992 , all EU heads of states agreed during the Maastricht Summit that all member states would adopt a unified foreign policy and speak in one voice .
However , two years later , the so-called " unified foreign policy " saw a complete failure for the first time in dealing with the issue of Bosnia .
From the Maastricht Summit till today , the 10-year-old EU foreign policy has little to show off .
It is even worse that the EU 's foreign policy has completely failed to pass the test of big events .
The member states ' different views on the US war in Iraq has demonstrated this and has once again exposed its deadly political defect . That is it can be easily divided and defeated by other big powers .
On February 24 , President Bush announced that he would support a constitution amendment of banning homosexual marriage .
This is an obvious turn from his ambiguous attitude toward the issue in several months and represents an important political development in the US election year .
The constitution amendment banning homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern US , which is a newly emerging base of the Republican Party . But It also has very negative effect because it is a cultural dispute that can split the public opinion all around the US , which is likely to aggravate US political polarization and further alienate the eastern and western costal areas dominated by the liberals .
It is obvious that Bush 's deeds have gone against his words as he claimed to be a " unifier " instead of a " splitter " during the 2000 election campaign .
In addition , the American younger generation has become more and more open on the issue of homosexual marriage . Bush 's move will have short-term effect but will do harm to the Republican Party 's long-term interests .
Bush 's new constitution amendment campaign can be seen as a " scorched earth policy " in this year 's presidential election .
Bush has adopted this policy because he has been increasingly troubled by the two topics of " anti-terrorism " and economy-employment and has to open new battlefields on topics of religions and cultures to split the public opinion .
The United States has so far taken a cautious attitude .
In other words , since maintaining Taiwan Straits ' status quo is in the interests of the US long-term objective of containing the mainland , the US is trying to avoid political and military clashes with China as a result of encouraging Taiwan independence .
It is predictable that the US is unable to completely eliminate the room for Taiwan to hold a referendum as requested by Beijing , but considering its own interests it will take some moves of early warning .
Recently , US Secretary of State Powell has taken the initiative to reiterate the Taiwan policy set before to show US opposition to Taiwan independence .
These remarks are seen to prevent Chen Shui-bian from taking extremist actions .
The recent remarks made by some US intelligence individuals with government backgrounds and a large number of espionage ships sent by the US to the Taiwan Straits to conduct reconnaissance on the cross-strait military movement all have indirectly demonstrated that the US is closely watching the situation across the Taiwan Strait .
It has shown from another perspective that although the US will not prevent Taiwan from holding the referendum as requested by Beijing , it is likewise concerned about the uncertainties existing in the situation of the Taiwan Strait .
Any large-scale and one to one election will eventually have one result , which is either Chen Shui-bian narrowly wins the re-election or Lian Chan reenters Taiwan 's presidential palace .
What worries people most is that under the circumstance of the imbalance of information dissemination , personages of various circles in the mainland have not seemed to be prepared for the possibility that Chen Shui-bian is still likely to win .
If the election result is not what has been expected , Beijing will , once again , fall into an unnecessary and passive position .
An old Arabian saying goes like this : " One day of chaos is more fearful than a thousand years of tyranny . "
Is this what currently worries Northeastern Asian countries ?
I think the answer is perhaps affirmative .
A research and development center , which is close to Washington and sponsored by the US government , has discussed four policy options in a study to deal with North Korea 's nuclear crisis , namely exchanges , containment , economic sanctions and preemptive strike operations .
The attitudes of the regional countries towards these policies are the focus of this investigation .
In addition , the investigation also analyzes the threats posed by North Korea 's nuclear weapon program on the basis of people 's opinions about the possibility of a nuclear attack and its possible damages as well as their fears in North Korea 's neighboring countries .
China and Russia believe that there is little or very little possibility that North Korea will use nuclear weapons while people in Japan and South Korea think there is a great threat .
All the Northeastern Asian countries support maintaining exchanges with North Korea .
Japan supports containment . Other countries also believe that under certain circumstance , the policy of containment is acceptable .
Singapore cares very much about its international rankings and pays much attention to various lists of national standings presented by European and US agencies all year round .
Being on the top of the lists frequently has naturally increased our interests in standings .
However , there is lots of annoyance about topping the standings on everything .
Ordinary citizens believe that too much concern about the standings has demonstrated the fear of being defeated while too much emphasis on our own standings shows the arrogance .
So people say we should live an easier life and we 'd better stand aloof from worldly strife .
Since many people seemed to distain the standings in the past very much , there has been an interesting phenomenon that people seem to no longer regard " topping the world " as a good news , instead they tended to regard it as an embarrassment .
However , things have changed over the past one or two years .
We have cast doubts on the country 's long-term competitiveness . All walks of life are also worried about the loss of their jobs .
Having such doubts , we no longer talk with ease .
The international competition remains fierce . Excessive ease will allow others to overtake you . It is also easy to go from leading in everything to lagging behind in everything .
On the surface , it appears that Bush is very loyal to Cheney . At the Republican Party 's Governors Congress last month , Bush promised that Cheney would be the only vice presidential candidate .
But he half jokingly said that he had entrusted Cheney to look for a vice presidential candidate for him just like in 2000 .
Cheney , who has long been keeping a low profile , has also been frequently interviewed by the media recently , denying that he would be replaced .
However , he has also prepared himself an out .
He said that he would retreat from difficulties if there was a health problem or if he felt he would become a real burden for the president .
Cheney is 63 years old and has suffered four heart attacks .
It is widely reported that the US army has , in fact , surrounded Osama and will capture him once the time is ripe .
The presidential electoral voting will begin on November 2 . It is said that the Pentagon had arranged a good play of the capture of Osama in October .
However , a long delay means more uncertainties . If Osama succeeds in fleeing away , many troubles will come up in the future .
It seems that Giuliani can truly be regarded as a safe trump card for Bush to win the votes .
The two rivals in the 2004 US presidential election have been affirmed : Democratic candidate Kerry will challenge the Republican incumbent President Bush .
They will begin promotion , debates and other " warm-up campaigns " before the November election .
They will be likely to debate with words and articles on the three topics of war , economy and society .
Bush believes that war is closely linked to the US national security ; the war against Saddam and anti-terrorism are to ensure America 's security , so he tells the Americans : " We are in a war . "
Kerry will naturally find faults with Bush that he has abused the faulty intelligence of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction to launch the war against Iraq .
As to the economy , Kerry believes that Bush 's tax cut-off plan is in the interests of the rich and cannot create new job opportunities .
Bush will show Kerry : Aren 't the US economic indexes going up ?
In terms of social issues , take the relationship between man and woman for example , Bush opposes homosexual marriage , abortions and supports the death penalty ; Kerry also opposes homosexual marriage but supports abortions and opposes the death penalty .
How will Bush and Kerry express their views on the three big issues and convince the voters through advertisements , TV and speeches will be political shows to be staged in the coming eight months .
However , in terms of diplomacy , Kerry has a larger room to perform .
According to statistics , young people who commit suicide are mostly aged between 15 and 19 , but there are still some aged between 10 and 14 .
Generally speaking , academic pressure is a cause of young people 's suicide . However , research found that emotional problems , especially the love affairs between man and woman and the relationship with their parents , are the main causes of young people 's suicide .
Academic pressure and failing to meet expectations are certainly topics that parents and children should communicate with each other .
Academic pressure is an inevitable burden for local students . The pressure sometimes comes from themselves but in many occasions , it is imposed on the children by their parents .
Parents have high expectation for their children 's good academic performance and often compare them with other children , requiring them to try to become the top students , which will certainly bring much pressure . However , the communication channels behind the pressure are the real thermometer to measure the intimate relationship between parents and their children .
If a child 's performance is below expectation , their parents ' beating and scolding or straightening their faces as a silent blame , or even making the child feel he / she is disappointing will undoubtedly push the child into a helpless and desperate position .
It is reported that many young students who need guidance are forced by their parents ' high expectation to a desperate position and get psychological troubles .
Singapore 's success and rapid development have made parents feel that their children 's current material condition is much better than that of their own in the past , so they cannot help believing that their children should perform better than they did .
In many occasions , parents have forgotten the fact that when they were in their childhood , their performances in various fields might not be , in fact , very excellent , either .
At the age of one and a half year old , most children will be sent to nurseries for a full-time child-care in various department units . The authorities will symbolically charge a little for the child-care . Children go back home once every week or even every month .
Today , Singapore faces the social problems of a decreasing birth rate and an aging population .
The younger generation is unable even to fend for themselves to maintain a modern living standard and fashionable material comforts , how can they have the energy to follow the government 's call for early marriage and early childbirth .
The writer has a bold suggestion : the government takes the responsibility to raise newly born children .
The citizens are only responsible for giving births and will not have to care about the issue of raising children .
On one hand , the government opens full-time boarding nurseries and kindergartens and converts primary schools to full-time operations , or even provides three meals and symbolically charges the citizens what they can afford .
This not only helps to settle the problem of unemployment , but also will free the government from worries over whether such measures as offering baby bonds , prolonging maternity leave , raising the quality of housemaids and offering tax rebates are effective or not .
What Beijing needs to do is not only to act as a host of the six-party talks , but also keeps in mind China 's long-term interests in the Korean Peninsular to prepare for the worst and carry out strategic plans as early as possible .
In specific , Beijing should , on one hand , urge North Korea to give up its nuclear arms , and on the other hand , it should begin with reforming Kim Jong Il 's regime to lead it to a modern road in order to eliminate the danger of a nuclear war in northeastern Asia , to maintain the status quo of the Korean Peninsular and to gain a strategic bargaining counter in dealing with the US in the long run .
Pyongyang is fierce of mien but faint of heart and is eager to develop its economy and get integrated into the international community .
However , this aspiration is often expressed through a tough and irrational extrinsic form , which sometimes completely goes against international rules .
In fact , for a long time , Beijing has been making use of its influence and economic means to force Pyongyang to change its stance which goes against the international rules .
However , such action still needs to be fully planned .
Beijing 's assistance to Pyongyang should not be restricted to the economic area and should be expanded to other social areas . It should not be only focused on Pyongyang 's abandonment of nuclear programs , instead it should focus on leading the country to a road of modern civilization .
When Kerry first entered the arena , nobody expected him to win . At that time , all the attention was focused on former Vermont Governor Dean .
However , in January , before the party 's congress was held in Iowa , Kerry suddenly emerged and won the party 's congress and the preliminary elections in the two most important states , Iowa and New Hampshire .
In the following preliminary elections in various states , Kerry seldom lost . His only losses came in states where they had their own candidates .
It only took Kerry six weeks to develop from a candidate with little prospect to the final candidate . All his rivals , including Gephardt , Lieberman , Clark , Dean and Edwards failed one by one . This has made people to look at his political charm with new eyes .
Being a senator for 19 years , Kerry has been supporting abortion and environmental protection policies . He opposes the tax reduction plan that is in the interests of the rich , dedicated to increasing the minimum wages and expects to settle the problem of global warming .
His working experience in Washington D.C. has demonstrated his willingness to face tough social issues , his courage of challenging the authority and seeking values as well as his fearlessness of impairing some people 's interests .
China 's reform and opening up policy began in the agricultural sector . Rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of the policy .
However , since the 1990s , the economic policies have given more attention to urban areas , bringing the agricultural reforms to a standstill and resulting in an increasing gap between the urban and rural areas .
With the lapse of time , two completely different worlds have appeared in China . One is the highly prosperous urban area and the other is the poor and backward countryside .
Quoting an official comment from China , the enlarging gap between China 's urban and rural areas is " a problem during the course of development " and will only be settled by sustainable development .
In other words , China 's costal areas and urban areas should continue to develop instead of being burdened by the problems in rural areas .
However , when some big cities see a small change in one year and a big change in three years , people cannot help asking why no changes have taken place in some poor areas over the past 10 years .
Of course , the way of development is different in urban and rural areas , which is a fact that should be admitted . However , the problem is when a large amount of money is invested in the urban construction and to encourage and support the wealthy middle-class , whether the rural population , which holds 70 % of the country 's total population , is also being concerned about and has been given much attention to ?
In theory , all previous Chinese governments have paid great attention to the issues concerning agriculture , rural areas and farmers .
However , over the past few years , the situation in the rural areas has deteriorated , which demonstrates that the degree of attention is becoming increasingly inadequate .
In any country , the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts are supposed to be the symbol of justice and fairness and also are important systems to safeguard social stability .
Unfortunately , the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts have become a symbol of corruption in China .
A recent report issued by the National Audit Administration said an investigation of the financial affairs of police departments in 26 provinces and cities showed that a total of 16.5 billion Yuan had been abused by police departments around the country in violation of rules .
The confidence crisis in the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts has come out into the open .
The incidents of Liu Yong and Sun Zhigang and the recent " BMW " incident in Heilongjiang have all reflected such deep distrust .
The incident of " BMW " is more typical .
People have paid more attention to the issue than to the " SARS " even during the period of the " SARS " epidemic .
In fact , what people were paying attention to was not the " BMW " incident itself , instead they have expressed their distrust of the whole legal system .
The relevant departments were very clear about this so they ordered a blackout of the media .
However , the problem is still there .
The second round of six-party talks on the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsular has come to an end as what people have generally expected .
During the talks , the parties concerned have come into contact with and sounded one another about the peripheral issues of the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis and have reached common ground on issues of holding the third round of talks by the end of June this year and the establishment of a working team .
However , the talks have made not only no progress on substantial issues including how North Korea should give up its nuclear research program and how the US will ensure North Korea 's political and military security and provide energy resources to North Korea after the country abandons the nuclear program , but also have left an impression of a more and more tightening fast knot .
The two leading roles , North Korea and the US , have not made any compromise and the two sides ' basic stances are not changed .
However , what catches attention is that the US has shown an attitude that it was not eager to settle the issue and has left an impression of " dilatoriness " .
The US strategy is closely linked to the new development of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in such new developments .
Since the Roosevelt administration , the US has not seen so many company bosses in prison .
Is this a coincidence or the public and investors can no longer tolerate corporate crimes and other illegal acts over the past three years , leading to these crimes discovered one after another recently ?
The answer is perhaps not simple , but it is a true fact that many corporate crimes have been discovered recently .
This is a good sign for the economic recovery and for rebuilding investors ' confidence in particular .
Late 1990s was probably one of the most chaotic and unpredictable periods in US business history . The earlier its influence disappears , the better .
When everything is settled , some companies ' names will definitely fade into history and will only be found in textbooks of business schools .
Other companies , such as Tyco and MCI will , under the leadership of new management teams , try to restructure themselves to face the coming of a new round of economic growth .
When will the new round of economic growth come ?
As a CEO , you may not have an answer .
But it doesn 't matter , because Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Greenspan doesn 't have the answer either .
The Bush administration expects to stimulate the economy with the help of the Keynesian Theory , by greatly increasing expenditures ( especially defense expenses ) on one hand , and sharply reducing taxes on the other .
In the international front , the Bush administration continues to push forward free trade but the trade deficit has reached a new high of 540 billion US dollars .
After a sharp tax reduction , investment and consumption have not seen obvious increase .
The New Keynesian school , represented by renowned British economist Wyme Godley , believes that the US economy is already in trouble .
They believe that the so-called " market law in command " is only an illusion and is surely to benefit a small number of people and do harms to most others .
People used to believe that around the world the so-called small number of beneficiaries were in the US and most people suffering losses were all in the developing countries .
However , this is not true today .
Many people in the US economist circle believe that the winners of the current globalization are US-based multinational companies . In addition , India and China are also in an outstanding position .
India has occupied the service economic sector while China has dominated the manufacturing sector .
Much attention has been paid to the great transfer of US funds and manufacturing equipments to China but few have come to realize the advantages of China 's high-quality and low-income labor market .
Firstly , whether Taiwan 's situation is within Beijing 's expectation .
Only Beijing knows what is its prediction , but the result of the prediction can be judged from what we can see publicly .
Over the past four years , the Taiwan independence camp led by Chen Shui-bian and Lu Xiu-lian has had clear-cut slogans and diligent as well as nimble actions . The moves of Taiwan independence have made some positive progress .
In comparison , except for occasional warnings , Beijing 's attitude looks like a mere formality and seems indifferent to the development of Taiwan independence .
However , since last fall , it has completely changed like an ox cart turning to a vehicle . It has been very obvious over the past few months that its ability of handling the issue is totally different from that in 1990s .
From this , we can predict that Taiwan 's situation is within its prediction .
Secondly , look at the diplomacy concerning Taiwan .
In terms of the development of the situation across the Taiwan Straits , we should see whether the stances of major countries including the US are closer to Beijing or to Taipei .
Since these countries ' stances are open , the answer is very clear .
So far , various countries have not only got closer to Beijing with more exchanges and alienated from Taipei with fewer exchanges , but also have begun to offer " earnest " advice to Taiwan 's democracy , which has long been praised .
