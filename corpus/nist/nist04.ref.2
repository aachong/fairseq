Rifts within The Commanding System of The Largest Rebellious Group in Liberia Are Deepened
( AFP in Monrovia on 12th ) After the Leader of " LURD " Conneh was expelled , power struggle within this largest rebellious army group is growing tense . A leader of the rebellious army insists that Conneh still maintain the power .
LURD rose up in 1999 to fight against the former president Taylor and kindled the 4-year-long civil war in Liberia . Now it occupies about 4 fifths of Liberia .
In mid-August last year Taylor agreed to exile to Nigeria so as to pave way for peace agreement in this western African country . The former government , the rebellious army and the out-parties formed an interim government .
But a group which calls itself " High Military Command " of LURD accuses Conneh of selling the post of LURD in the transitional government to fill his own pocket . Some time ago it adopted Aisha Keita Conneh , the divorced wife of Conneh , as the new leader .
But Dweh , parliament speaker of the transitional government and founder of LURD , insists that only the national executive committee of LURD has the right to recall the leader of the organization .
He told the media the night before last : " I founded LURD in Nigeria ; I can guarantee to the Liberian people that there is no rift within LURD and nothing can sabotage the peace process . "
Dweh attributes the internal strife to the behind-the-scene manipulation of the transitional government leader Bryant and other LURD leaders who serve in the transitional government .
Bryant who used to be a merchant was appointed last October as the leader of this war-ridden country until 2005 general election .
Dweh accuses the ministers of justice , communications and labor of colluding with Aisha Conneh , supported by Bryant , promising her that she would be the LUDR leader as soon as Conneh is out of power .
He warns that , if Bryant continues to violate the peace accord , the warring parties will return to Accra where the accord was prepared and discuss whether Bryant should be replaced .

Rose told the 1995 incident to the investigators ; the case is part of the 20-month-long investigation into embezzlements in the boxing fields .
Rose turned down the bribery and knocked down the ever-victorious Esch in the second round of the match on Madison Square Garden .
New York Daily News went to the residence of Esch in Alabama and asked whether or not he believed what Rose said . Esch defended Top Rank , saying : " Rose is no match in strength . How is it possible for you to ask a boxer to purposely lose when his record is 1 win and 6 defeats ? I don 't think Top Rank violates the law . "
FBI went to Las Vegas on 6th to inspect the headquarters of Top Rank and confiscated some of its financial and medical documents and computers .

Shrinking Workforce to Knock Economic Output in EU , Japan
( AFP in Davos , Switzerland on 19th ) The European Union 's share of global economic output is reduced almost half by 2050 as its workforce shrinks , according to a study report published today by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) and US consultancy firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide .
By contrast the plenty of labor in such developing countries such as India and China should help to promote economic growth .
Sammans , a managing director at the WEF , said " Economic output is determined by labour force growth and productivity rates , "
In countries where labor force is in serious short supply , commodities and labor supply probably cannot meet the needs and living standards . "
A report entitled " Living happier ever after : the economic implications of aging societies " points out that because of the prolonging of people 's lives due to medical progress , the retirees , in relation to labor force , will continue to increase ( especially in the developed countries ) , which finally will exercise immediate impact on economic production .

The statement also warns " that the proportion of Japan will shrink from 8 % to 4 % . "
The Damage of Artistic Works by The Israeli Ambassador in Sweden Gave Rise to The Diplomatic Dispute between The Two Countries .
( AFP in Stockholm on 18th ) A work of art in memory of a Palestinian suicidal bomb attacker in the Swedish History Museum was damaged by the Israeli ambassador Mazel in Sweden . It has given rise to a dispute which has developed into a diplomatic strife due to the intervention by Israeli Prime Minister Sharon .
Ambassador Mazel visited Stockholm Museum last Friday when he saw a work of art on show which portrays a suicidal attacker in Haifa in October last year . He deliberately damaged it , for which he expelled by the museum authority . This has led to a diplomatic conflict between Israel and Sweden .
Israel demands that Sweden remove this exhibit , which was turned down by Sweden .
The event has been extensively covered by Swedish press .
The exhibition is part of an international Conference sponsored by the Swedish government on racial massacre . Israel will also attend the conference .
The on-the-spot video-tape shows the Israeli ambassador tearing down the spotlight of the conference hall and throwing it into water , resulting in the short circuit of the artistic work . Afterwards , the museum president ordered that Ambassador Mazel leave the museum .
Today Israeli Prime Minister Sharon supported Mazel , which resulted the event developed into an all-round diplomatic dispute .
The work of art on display is chiefly a ship named " White Snow " sailing on sea . On the stem is a picture of smiling Hanadi Jaradat which serves as the sail .
Hanadi was a Palestine lawyer on probation who lived in Israel and whose younger brother had been killed by an Israeli bomb . To avenge her brother she launched a suicidal bomb attack last October in the northern Israeli city of Haifa , killing 21 Israelis and causing a new round of Israel vs Palestine conflicts .
Mazel said : " I cannot bear to see this picture . It is a great hurt to the victims ' family members of Haifa bombing . As the Israeli ambassador , I cannot be aloof and indifferent about the picture which stand facts on their head . "

( AFP in Washington on 18th ) The Democratic Party 's candidates who seek to replace Bush in the White House point out today one after another that the latest suicidal bomb attack which caused great casualties is an evidence showing the failure of American policies towards Iraq .
The attack killed at least 25 and injured about 30 . This is the attack that has caused greatest casualties since American occupied Iraq .
Democratic Party 's opponents of Bush attack Bush 's Iraqi policies in strong terms . Some claim that the attack is the latest evidence of the failure of Bush 's policies towards Iraq .
Senator Edwards from North Carolina told Columbia Broadcasting Corporation : " Our policies have failed . I don 't know why the government is unwilling change . "
He said : " Obviously , the first thing we should do is to internationalize the peace-keeping troops in Iraq . The other thing is to hand over the transitional administration to UN . "
The former president Carter and the Democratic Party 's candidate Dean said when they made appearance in public that the Iraqi war led by US " has proved not only that it was based on wrong information and misguided statements " , but also that the latest attack " continues to show it is a tragedy " .

Iraqi Guerillas Attack Helicopters of The US Army with Hi-Tech Weapons
( AFP in Washington on 18th ) Senior American army officers say that Iraqi insurgents attack US helicopters with increasingly precision weapons .
A group of senior officials who are familiar with a confidential report told New York Times that a confidential military report reveals Iraqi guerrillas attack US helicopters with grenades propelled by rockets and heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles .
They claim that the report had been prepared before US helicopters were attacked on 3 occasions this month . However , the recent 3 attacks further confirm the conclusion of the report .
The report aims to provide US pilots with methods of how to evade attacks by such weapons . The officials are reluctant to discuss the new contents recently discovered .
But judging from the new round of attacks in Iraq , people cannot help feeling worried that Iraqi guerrillas have carefully studied the fighting style of American aircrafts .
Researchers have found that Iraqi guerrillas have used SA-16 shoulder-fired missiles more than once , which is really worrying .
Missiles with such precision guidance systems can hardly be evaded by pilots .
A senior US pilot in the Persian Gulf said : " Every successful attack of our aircrafts is a great victory strategically for our enemy .
Not only it is covered by media but also it is a clear-cut judgement of victory or defeat . Therefore , our enemy believes it is a useful maneuver . "
Since October 25 last year , 9 US helicopters have already been downed or crashed with at least 49 US soldiers killed .

The war has started despite my endeavor . And it is now proven that it is not only based on wrong information and misguided statements but it has continuously demonstrated to be a tragedy . "
Carter calls Dean a powerful " champion for peace " . Although he did not give endorsement to his statement , American TV stations all report his speech .
As left-wing former governor of a northern state Dean may be at a disadvantage in Southern states when confronting the retired general Clark , a middle-of-the-roader from Arkansas . But Carter 's support may increase his chance of victory in southern states whose positions are conservative and which are more religious .
Carter said recently in a TV interview that he believes that Dean is the most likely candidate in Democratic Party to oppose to Bush .

The transport authorities said that the other dozens of flights to Frankfurt had been delayed . The Frankfurt air traffic may be affected by the weather the whole day today .
In France traffic control is imposed in Paris after the snowfall last night , but similar measures in other French areas have been removed this morning .
It is reported that all services in the major airports of Paris have almost returned to the normal . The snow and fog caused many flights to postpone in the D 'Gaulle Airport yesterday .
However , Paris Airport Authorities advise air passengers to make sure whether their flights are puncture before leaving home .
Most of France is covered with snow except the Mediterranean areas .
Taiwan and Japan are both democratic nations , which have obligation and responsibilty to work together for consolidation of Democracy in Asia .
In order to advocate the value of democracy the government of our country will soon set up " Taiwan Foundation for Democracy " which will regard international cooperation of political parties as one of its priorities on its agenda .
The Democratic Progressive Party wishes to work hand in hand with democratic parties of other countries by this means and share its development experience in democratic progress with other countries , make contribution to peace , stability and prosperity of Asia and realize the ideal of " Asian Democratic League " as early as possible .
Today when the international situation changes instantly fast , the fluctuation of regional powers causes changes in the entire world and the security of every nation is on trial .
As far as the Asian and Pacific region is concerned , North Korea who is arrogant to have nuclear facilities has trial-launched missiles many times since US started its war against Iraq last month . The missiles flew over Japanese territorial sky . Besides , China has accelerated its arms expansion and aimed its missiles at Taiwan since long time ago .
All of this has posed a great menace to the security of Taiwan , Japan and the whole Asian-Pacific region .
Such issues as related to consolidating democracy and maintaining security can only be discussed and solved through a formal security mechanism .
Today 's conference is the first formal dialogue on security between the Democratic Progressive Party in power in Taiwan and the Liberal Democratic Party in power in Japan and parliament members of other political parties . Its importance is obvious .
I myself hope that , in addition to the bilateral dialogue between Taiwan and Japan , the peripheral countries of Asian-Pacific region like US , Japan and South Korea will work together to promote the establishment of " a security dialogue mechanism " , to support Taiwan in participating in the multi-lateral dialogues and to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .
Today it is an important moment which encourages us to continue our march on the road of reform . We give our highest regard to all the comrades in the party who embody our Party spirit and endeavor to achieve the goal of reform together .
" Political parties withdrawing from the radio and TV media " is the most fundamental requirement of medium reform and also the idea which the Democratic Progressive Party has always adhered to . The Democratic Progressive Party in power will accelerate the pace of reform instead of being a hindrance or a burden .
We are also aware that to achieve this goal the Party members of public service should take the lead to leave media . Although this is a small step in the reform , it is also a key step .
In the past age of martial law and medium monopoly , many of the Party comrades , in order to strive for an open space for public opinion , have shouldered the difficult mission to set up the 4th TV station and local broadcasting stations . They wished to break through the existent limitation and add vigor to promote the reform of medium environment by this means .
For example , Comrade Trong Chai took painstaking efforts for the birth of the 4th TV station and " Formosa Television " was born at last .
This success had considerable impact on the whole medium environment . It broke up the monopoly by 3 stations and created larger space for the progress of CATV .
But we must know that there are many deeds we have to do in the process of reform due to limits of historical environment . Therefore , today 's complete open and free medium space represents the achievement of some periodic tasks . To continue the reform process , we have to give up things and make sacrifice .
The standing members of the Party Central Committee demand that all the party members of public service withdraw from TV medium business before the next session of the legislative opens. i.e. before September 5 so as to set an example and honor their promise to the people .
We greatly appreciate all your efforts to adhere to Party 's ideals and goals , including Trong Chai , Chang Chun-hsiung , Chou Ching-yu , Hou Shui-sheng , Kao Meng-ting , Hwang Nai-hui and Shen Ming-gong who gave up their personal interests to promote the medium reform .
To be a ruling party does not mean the holding of power but the increase of responsibilities .
The Democratic Progressive Party has suffered setbacks and bumps in the process of holding power , but we can always turn challenges into motives for advance and lead Taiwan in constructing the project of deepening its democracy . At the same time we try to meet international standards in global democracy , peace and prosperity .
For we are always convinced that only the people are the masters of the country and the responsibility of the Democratic Progressive Party is to upgrade the Party 's founding spirit of " clean , diligence and love for the homeland " to the prospects of " reform , progress and a good life " so as to lay a foundation for the long-term peace for the 23 million people in Taiwan .
For a long time the Democratic Progressive Party has played the role of " part of the government " in the effort to expand the diplomacy of Taiwan and has made outstanding achievements in this regard .
We have never yielded to the continual pressure from the Communist Party of China because we have destiny in our own hands . Even if there are no rich resources , the Democratic Progressive Party has made headways step by step and has created room for Taiwan to participate in international affairs .
" Multi-diplomacy " has been the chief axis of the overall diplomatic strategy of the Democratic Progressive Party . In the past year we have , based on the platform of " Asian Federation of Liberal Democracy " , carried out successful experience sharing and party exchange with the countries in the region on such issues as East Asia 's economic challenges , democratic reform of political parties , sweeping away money politics , global poverty , political publicity and communication , youth participation in politics .
I will take over the chairman of " CALD " in March of next year and wish to create more opportunities for Taiwan to contribute more to the international community in the capacity of a world organization leader .
Besides , the Democratic Progressive Party took an active part in the affairs of " Liberal International " after it became its member last year .
Apart from sending its representative to the London head office of the Federation , the Democratic Progressive Party will cooperate with other member parties and hold forums in central and southern America and Europe on political reform .
On September 28 , this Party of ours spent its 17th birthday .
The Democratic Progressive Party , 17 years of age , has upheld its ideal of democracy since its birth and is now filled with the power of reform and progress .
It is because we have been on the side of democracy and reform that we have won the trust of the Taiwan people . It is because of this that the responsibilities and missions we bear for the future become even more grave and great .
Three years ago we took over the load of ruling the country . The past ruling parties in the 1990s had the constitution revised 6 times with a tortuous way .
In 1991 overall re-election of the parliament was held ; in 1994 the president was directly elected ; in 1997 the provincial government organizations were frozen ; in 2000 the National Assembly became non permanent . The series of constitution revisions are the legality trail of Taiwan people in intensifying sovereignty and democracy .
If we regard the direct election of the president in 1996 as the most significant sign to show that Taiwan has become a democracy with independent sovereignty , this country " in its integrity " is already over 10 years old .
After 10 years of practice we should ponder what to pursue next as a democracy with independent sovereignty .
We must say that at the next stage we should further pursue more profound democracy and more efficient constitutional government system . Only by doing this can we lead the Taiwan people in confronting severe challenges of the new century .
Asia is the largest continent in the world . Its area is nearly 30 % of the earth 's land surface and now its population accounts for about 60 % of the whole world . Its total economic volume takes up one fourth of the world 's total . It should and is well capable of making outstanding contributions to the world 's peace and development .
Asia has long and brilliant cultures . The drainage areas of the Yellow River and the Yangtze , the Indus and the Ganges valleys , and the reaches of the Euphrates and the Tigris are famous birthplaces of human civilizations .
In the long process of historical development the Asian peoples have written splendid chapters for the development of human civilization .
In modern times Asian has experienced hardships and sufferings . People of various country have made unremitting efforts for liberation and development and have gained tremendous achievements .
But there is still a long way to go if Asia wishes to have a new rise and to enjoy new prosperity .
To strengthen cooperation , promote development and achieve win-for-all is a way Asia must follow in order to rise and become prosperous . It is also where the fundamental interest of the Asian people lies .
In the new situation of the new century Asian development faces new opportunities .
Peace and development are the themes of the contemporary world and the overall peaceful international environment provides favorable external conditions for Asian development .
The deepening economic globalization , the giant strides of the world technological revolution , the optimizing regrouping of international production factors and the accelerated industry transfer are favorable for Asian countries to utilize international capital , introduce advanced technologies , expand the world market and promote the economic development of their own countries .
Asian , with rich resources and vast markets , is an area in the world with the greatest economic vitality and with tremendous potentials for development .
Great population and under-development are the two state conditions of China .
With 1,300 million people in China , any problem , no matter how insignificant it may be , will become a big one if multiplied by 1,300 million . Any financial or material power , no matter how tremendous it may seem to be , will become a very very low level if divided by 1,300 million .
This is what the Chinese leaders must bear in mind at all times
To solve the problems of the 1,300 million people , we can depend on none other than ourselves .
Since the People 's Republic of China was founded , we have achieved a lot in our construction . But we have taken a roundabout course and lost some opportunities .
Since we initiated reform and opening-up in 1978 , we have finally found at last a right path for our own development .
In other words , the Chinese people should build socialism with Chinese characteristics in an independent way .
The essence of this path is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and development productive forces and respect and guarantee the freedom of the Chinese people to pursue happiness .
The reform and opening-up in China spread from the rural areas to the cities , from the economic realm to the fields of politics , culture and society .
In the final analysis , each step further aims at giving free play to all energy and initiatives of labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital and letting all sources of creating social wealth to flow completely .
Profound changes have taken place in the world in recent years . Science and technology have developed by leaps and bound ; the world production level has kept rising ; links of the world market are increasingly closer . All this offers historic opportunities for the development of all countries .
However , what is noteworthy is the fact that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemic diseases , the worsening of environment , etc. pose great threat to the world stability and development .
The negative influence of economic globalization add to the risks and costs for the economic and social development of developing countries . Some developing countries even face the danger of being out of mainstream .
Presently the world economy still faces a lot of uncertain factors although it is steadily being recovered .
The Doha round of multi-lateral trade talks suffered a setback . Trade protectionism and other complicated factors increase the difficulties for developing countries .
What is gratifying is that the developing countries have taken a positive enterprising spirit , been bent on reform , hard-working stance and have made remarkable achievement .
On the international arena developing countries , based on Non-aligned Movement and Group of 77 , have strengthened their unity and cooperation and made important contributions for safeguarding their own legal interests and changing the irrational orders of the world politics and economy . They have become important forces for the promotion of democracy in international relations .
In the meanwhile significant progress has been made in the exchange and cooperation between developing countries . The economic exchange between them has become more frequent .
From the Andes to the Mekong , from the Union de Maghreb to the establishment of African Federation , the South-South Co-operation has kept enriching , improving and updating itself in both content and form , mechanism and means .
The past year is a year of sustained overall development of friendship and cooperation between China and Canada .
The trade between the two nations is on the rise with the total trade approaching 10 billion USD .
Top leaders visit frequently each other . Canadian ministers of foreign affairs , national defense , environment and international cooperation have visited China . President of China 's Supreme Court and Chinese minister of commerce have visited Canada . What is more important is that the premiers of the 2 countries have visited each other .
Premier Wen Jiabao 's visit to Canada not long ago was of significance in carrying on the past and opening up for the future . It added new vigor to the further development of the bilateral relations laid a solid foundation for developing the friendship and cooperation in great breadth and depth .
China and Canada will continue to intensify their cooperation in such fields as politics , economy , culture , education , science and technology and will strive to double their bilateral trade volume by 2010 .
Dear compatriots and dear friends ,
although you reside overseas , you are concerned with your homeland , with its construction and development . At every critical moment you share weal and woe with the people of your motherland and your pulse beats simultaneously with that of the motherland .
Last year when some regions in China were hit by SARS and flood , you expressed your deep concern and blessings for the people of the homeland through web , correspondence , telephone and contributions . Overseas Chinese from all circles sponsored series of donation activities and charity performances . After " the Shenzhou 5 " manned space ship was successfully launched , your congratulation calls , letters and cards poured in and everyone felt encouraged and proud of China 's success in space flight technology .
During premier Wen Jiabao 's visit to Canada , hundreds of Chinese residents and students went to the airport and the parliament hill to greet the premier in bitter cold . There were many touching scenes .
I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my thanks to everyone . I believe you will do more contribution for China 's prosperity , for promotion of China-Canadian relationship , for China 's reunification and overall rejuvenation .
First , to promote mutual political trust and deepen the strategic cooperation .
China and France , the permanent members of the Security Council of UN , are both influential to international affairs .
Both of our two countries are for the promotion of world pluralism and for safeguarding the UN authority , willing to help set up a new political and economic order in conformity with the interest of the people of all countries .
Our two countries share an extensive consensus and common interest in dealing with various challenges confronting mankind and in handling major international affairs .
We are ready to strengthen our dialogue and consultation with France on such important issues as fighting against terrorism , preventing nuclear proliferation , cracking down on transnational crimes , promoting common development and intensifying the role of UN . We will forge close cooperation and be committed to safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .
Secondly , to step up economic and trade cooperation so as to achieve mutual benefit and mutual complementation .
China , the largest developing country in the world , is devoted to its modernization drive . It offers extensive and vast markets .
France , a developed country , ranks on the top in the economic and technological level in the world . It leads the world in technology in many fields .
The two countries are highly mutual complementary in economy and have great potentials for economic and trade collaboration .
Since New China was established in 1949 , Chinese government has attached great importance to developing relations with Africa and has worked out a series of policies .
We have always abided by the 5 principles of peaceful coexistence and respected the right of African countries to independently choose their political systems and path of development . We have supplied as much aid as we can to African countries and carried out economic and technological cooperation . We have supported African countries in their unity and cooperation to become strong , urged the international community to pay enough attention to peace and development in Africa and backed African countries to equally participate in international affairs . We have intensified consultation and cooperation between China and Africa so as to jointly defend the interests of developing countries .
Sino-African friendship has had a long history and has stricken roots in the hearts of the people .
Ever since New China was established in 1949 , we have always supported the national liberation cause in Africa and sincerely aided African countries to develop their national economies .
Chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers sent to Africa have worked shoulder to shoulder with the local people and their friendship is as profound as that between brothers .
On international affairs China and African countries have understood each other and supported each other . We have become trusted partners .
The Chinese people will never forget that it was with the powerful support of developing countries including African countries that China successfully restored its legitimate UN seat at the 26th General Assembly of UN in 1971 .
In recent years mutual political trust has been deepened between people at different levels and from different fields in China and Africa ; economic and trade cooperation has been fruitful ; friendly exchange in the fields of culture , education , public health , science and technology and sports has progressed vigorously . The Sino-African Cooperation Forum set up early in the century has formed a new platform for the development of Sino-African relation and deepening of cooperation .
China and Africa are resolved to forge a long , stable and new partnership of equality and mutual benefits . The Sino-African friendly cooperation has entered a new stage of overall development .
7 years after Nixon visited China and the Sino-America Shanghai Communique was published , Carter Administration accepted China 's stand on Taiwan and effected the diplomatic relations between China and US .
This incident and the successful visit to US by Deng Xiaoping opened a new chapter in the annals of relations between China and US .
When Reagon was in power , fierce disputes occurred on Taiwan issue .
Hard talks between the governments of the two countries resulted in the well-known " August 17 " Communique in 1982 , with an agreement reached on partial settlement of arms sale to Taiwan .
Shanghai Communique , the Communique on establishing diplomatic relations between China and US and the " August 17 " Communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for Sino-American relations .
During the 10 years after the diplomatic relations were established , the Sino-American relations on the whole were stable with the exchange and cooperation in various fields , despite occasional strifes over the Taiwan issue and other problems .
In the 1980s and early 1990s , the most profound changes took place in the world situation since the Second World War : drastic changes in east Europe , the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War .
US took the lead in imposing sanctions against China , announced to sell 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan , linked human rights issue to the most-favored-nation treatment and permitted Lee Teng-hui to visit America . All this reduced Sino-American relations to a record low .
As China 's economy developed fast , its international position kept rising .
More and more Americans came to understand that the improvement and development of Sino-American relations were beneficial to both countries .
Half a year ago and in this very hall , we successfully started the process of 6-party talks and set the orientation for peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue .
For half a year , the parties have carried out uninterrupted dialogues and discussions and made lots of profound preparations for the new round of talks. through The process we have promoted the understanding of each other 's stand .
Now all the parties expect to talk about substantial problems and acquire the concrete achievements in the second round , are agreed on settling problems of common concern by concerted procedures and hope to continue the peace process started by the 6-party talks .
These form the important basis of our talks today .
The importance of the second round of talks lies in starting to discuss substantial issues . This indicates a new step forward in the peace talk process .
This round involves how to determine the concrete goals of settling nuclear problem , discusses the measures for the first stage of the settlement and studies the way of keeping the talk process going .
With the talk going in depth , we shall have to deal with more difficulties and greet more challenges , but this is the responsibility that history affords us and it is also the expectation of the international community .
We 6 parties gather here , representing the strong political wish of the governments and peoples of the 6 countries .
Our talk aims to expand our consensus , not to give prominence to our differences . Our aim is to solve problems , not to intensify contradictions .
The Chinese Party believes that all the parties are aware of their peace missions , will adopt constructive attitudes , show the spirit of cooperation and understanding , respect each other , display flexibility and narrow down the differences .
The second round of 6-party talks in Beijing has completed its scheduled agenda after 3 days of discussion .
I extend my thanks to the contribution made by the governments , delegation heads , delegates and the staff .
If we say the first round of talks determined the general goal of achieving nuclear-weapon-free on the peninsula , the significance of this round lies in carrying out substantial dialogues , a new step towards the realization of the general goal .
During the talks , all the parties conducted deep and constructive discussions , explored the ways and procedures of settling the problem with wisdom and sense , proposed valuable plans and made positive announcements of policies .
This talk has achieved a series of instructive results , especially a consensus has been reached on the next round and on setting up a working group . This is of great significance for pushing forward the talk process .
Dear colleagues , peace and development are the theme of this great age of ours .
Peoples of the 6 nations represented by the delegates present need peace , long for peace and love peace . Peoples of the world need peace , long for peace and love peace .
In the 3 days the international community has focused its attention on Beijing and on Diaoyutai . It cherishes great hopes on this round of talks .
Some people may think that the results of the talks are not many enough and the process is not fast enough .
My view is that this round of talks was started when the relevant parties were lack of trust each other and the difference between positions of the parties was widened .
The Chinese government has been consistent in its stand on Taiwan issue , i.e. the basic policy of " peaceful reunification ; one country and two systems " .
For this purpose we have made every endeavor , have shown the greatest sincerity and have lots of work .
However , our efforts met with provocation from Taiwan authorities and forces that advocate " Taiwan Independence " .
We respect the demand of Taiwan people for democracy , but we oppose the " Taiwan Independence " activities launched by Taiwan authorities and " Taiwan Independence " advocates in the name of democracy in order to separate Taiwan from its motherland .
The reason why we clearly demonstrate our determination and will to maintain the unity of our motherland is to maintain peace and stability in Taiwan region .
We have already made it clear that , so long as there is the slightest hope , we will do our best to reunify China by peaceful means .
We appreciate President Bush 's reiteration of his stand of one China , which sent a clear signal to the forces that advocate " Taiwan Independence " .
Leaders of Taiwan Authorities claim : " To prevent armed invasion of Taiwan by China and one-sided change of the status quo across the Strait , we advocate 3.20 public referendum . "
This is a slander of the peace efforts by the mainland and a provocation to the relations across the Strait .
At present the actual threat to Taiwan security does not come from mainland but from the " Taiwan independence " spitting activities launched on a large scale by the Taiwan authorities .
It is the splittism forces of " Taiwan independence " that sabotage the status quo of the relations across the Strait and are the immediate sources of menace against peace in Taiwan .
The Taiwan authorities distorted the position of the mainland to oppose " Taiwan independence " splittism and maintain Taiwan stability as a suppression of democracy and liberty of Taiwan . With this pretext , it plans to launch a public referendum .
This is sheer fabrication and confounding black with white . Its real aim is to win sympathy and support for its splittism line .
The leader of Taiwan authorities advocates the so-called " defensive public referendum " and " peaceful public referendum " , which , in whatever package they may be , will only give rise to opposition and hostility across the Strait , further aggravate the tension and push the relations across the Strait gradually onto the edge of danger .
This runs counter to the mainstream public opinion of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability and development . It is misleading to and a control of Taiwan public instead of a deepening of Taiwan democracy . It is also a menace to the peace and stability of the Asian-Pacific region . It will undoubtedly meet with the general opposition of the compatriots across the strait and the international community .
Making a general survey of the historical process of the development of the Chinese nation and you will find that unity has always been the mainstream , the general irresistible trend and the will of the people .
With growing increasingly stronger in China and the cooperation across the Strait being continuously promoted , the international community commonly acknowledges that one-China frame is more stable and any attempt to split China is bound to fail .
It is more than 2 weeks away from the lunar new year , one of the traditional festivals most popular with the Chinese people .
On this joyous and happy day we are accustomed to getting together with our relatives and friends and exchanging gifts to express good wishes .
The Hong Kong Post Service , with the intention of " transmitting good will and offering business opportunities " and with the cooperation of China Post , has unfolded this " China-Hong Kong Gift Delivery Service " which helps Hong Kong citizens to give their good wishes and blessings to relatives , friends and clients either in the mainland or in Hong Kong during the Spring Festival .
For a long time Hong Kong Post Service has cooperated with other postal authorities to provide special international delivery service .
At early as in December 2002 it worked with the Australian Post to provide western wine logistics service so as to supply quality products for Hong Kong residents .
This time the cooperation with China Post has upgraded our close cooperation that has always existed between us in postal business , remittance , express delivery , etc. to the level of logistics service . To meet the growing needs of Hong Kong residents to send gifts to relatives , friends and clients in the mainland , we have introduced this " China-Hong Kong Gift Delivery Service " .
The first batch of gifts are New Year Gift Boxes of various sizes and styles which contain the seasonally popular candies , tea leaves , sea foodstuffs , etc . With a great range of prices , there is enough room for choice .
They are all very presentable presents good for both relatives and business partners on the mainland .
For 30 years Consumer Council has made universally-recognized contribution in safeguarding the interest of consumers .
The best way to evaluate the work results of Consumer Council is to judge whether or not substantial improvement of consumers rights and interest has been made .
I agree to what Chairman Chen has just said very much . Through 30 years of work , not only are customers clear about their rights and interest , but also all circles of the society pay attention to their interest . This is the result of the efforts made by Consumer Council and the government .
Consumer Council conducts regular test of products and carries out market investigations and trade operation studies of various products and service . It also releases fair and objective market information through Choice , a monthly journal .
Very popular with the residents , Choice is having its web edition which will bring its function into effective play and help consumers acquire market information more conveniently and more quickly .
Consumer Council has set up 11 regional consumer consultation centers and 16 phone hotlines to provide information about commodities and services and to accept the consumers ' complaints .
Since its inception , Consumer Council has received more and more callers from the several thousand annually in 1970s to 146,000 last year , more than 20 times increase . This shows that more and more consumers choose to consult the reports and suggestions of Consumer Council before they make decisions in choosing products and service .
Besides , the number of complaints which have been handled by Consumer Council this year exceeds 26,000 .
Consumer Council also criticizes by name some stores and shops with malpractice , which not only helps consumers to avoid being cheated but also serves as a warning and intimidation to store keepers .
MP Yuang , I told you on July first that I was watching TV carefully . Later I had reflections and saw that some residents have appeals and complaints and are resentful against the administrative practices of the government .
In this aspect the government and I have been working hard to improve our work in the past six to seven months . Seeing that the residents are demanding for improvement of economy and livelihood , I have also made lots of efforts in this regard . Also knowing that the residents are complaining about Article 23 of Basic Law , we withdrew Article 23 . In fact the government responded promptly .
As to the demand for democracy in society , I am also aware of it .
But MP Yuang , I wish to tell you that , what I am doing today is to ensure everything goes smoothly once constitutional review begins . So some fundamental problems must be solved first . They are two different things .
What are the fundamental problems ?
Some are matters of principle and some are legal problems . As for some articles in Basic Law which involve institutional review , how should we understand them after all ? Work in this aspect must be done first .
We are right now doing this work . A group of three have started to do the job .
It may go and consult the Central Government and may also stay in Hong Kong and listen to the public opinions . I think this is a very good step . We made the decision because we attach important to the opinions of the Hong Kong society .
In today 's very competitive business environment , brand name plays an essential role for the success of products .
A famous brand cannot be created overnight . It needs innovative design , good quality , thoughtful package , effective marketing and sustained investment .
Hong Kong has conditions suitable for creation of famous brand name .
We have relevant know-how , skills and experience . We have rich talent resources from design to manufacture , to marketing , to management . We also have vast markets .
The CEPA which has just begun to be implemented adds to our advantages . Apart from zero tariffs to enter into the mainland market , its best advantage is to urge merchants to use their brains more often and strive to promote the added value of products so that their products become famous brands loved by consumers of Hong Kong , the mainland and even the whole world .
" The Hong Kong 10 Famous Brand Election " launched by Chinese Manufacturers Association and the added-value development trend of Hong Kong products pushed by CEPA happen to be a coincidence .
For 5 years the election has given birth to 51 " Hong Kong 10 Famous Brand " .
However , in such a vast market as the mainland , 51 famous brand are nothing . We need hundreds , thousands of , and even more and more " Hong Kong famous brand " .
Hong Kong Subway has participated in the subway projects of major cities in mainland . It brought its rich experience to the mainland market through service .
I feel happy that Hong Kong 's investment , professional service and managers are recognized for their quality in the mainland market .
Such exchange between Shenzhen and Hong Kong not only helps the developmet of the motherland but also affords more developing opportunities to Hong Kong businessmen . In addition to promoting economic development it also creates more job opportunities for Hong Kong .
The conclusion of the agreement in principle for the project results really from the policy support of the Central Government and the government of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . I feel grateful to them .
The Subway Company invests for the first time outside Hong Kong . It participates by investment in the development of a mainland subway and introduces the Hong Kong brand name to the mainland . This is really something gratifying for both Hong Kong people and mainland compatriots .
I hereby hope that Shenzhen No. 4 subway line will soon be approved by the Central Government . I wish success to the project so that a solid foundation is laid for more exchange and cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the future .
Today is January 5th of the lunar new year . I am glad to be invited by the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society to participate in your new year celebration and preside over the opening ceremony of the new year gold market .
First of all I would like to extend new year greetings to you . I wish you good luck , good fortune and every success in the year of monkey .
The gold price rocketed last year and it surpassed 400 USD per ounce recently . The continuous rise reflects that the investors have again gained confidence in gold .
I believe you have been busy in your business last year .
In fact the brisk market , apart from the influence from outside factors , shows the achievements of the Gold & Silver Trade Market after over 90 years of endeavor .
The endeavor not only has laid a good foundation stone for Hong Kong gold market but also has contributed a lot to consolidating Hong Kong 's status as an international finance center .
There is a saying that goes : " The whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring . " I hope my colleagues in the Gold & Silver Trade Market will continue to work hard , seize the opportune time to promote the further development of the market and try to meet the needs of gold trade brought about by the reform of mainland gold market , China 's accession to WTO and CEPA .
I am confident that , with the hard work of my colleagues , the Hong Kong gold market will surely score brilliant success in the coming year .
Lastly , I wish you lively transactions on gold market , prosperity in all trades and success in business in the year of monkey .
Thank you all .
However , the past challenge was not confined to aiding public house property . Private house property was also full of trial .
Financial storm broke out in 1997 and assets foam soon ruptured . As a result the price of real estate dropped by 70 % , dealing a serious blow to house owners . This also served as the main cause for the worsening deflation in the past 5 years .
Now economy is taking a turn for the better . We are resolved to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sustainable and sound development of the real estate market .
A sound real estate market is really essential for the further recovery of Hong Kong economy .
We are also devoted to the protection and improvement of our living habitat .
Our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development . We will adopt better city design , strengthen the protection of scenic spots and historical sites in Hong Kong and improve the living environment .
We will pay even more attention to the issue of overall environment .
The lesson of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong last year reminded us that we must exert ourselves to create a more spacious , cleaner and hygienically and healthy habitat .
We will intensify our efforts to beautify our environment by planting more trees , building more parks and providing more entertaining and fitness facilities for our residents .
I extend my thanks to many parliament members who have voiced their opinions on administration of justice , laws , constitution , public servants and the support of organizational staff and public security in the " Government Policy Address " delivered by the chief executive .
As for the category of judicial and legal service , only two parliament members Margaret NG and TSANG Yok-sing made speeches . They are chairman and vice-chairman of the Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services of the Legislative Council .
The Chief Executive puts forward many measures in his " Government Policy Address " to promote people-centered administration , including strengthening ties between chief officials and the society , conducting more researches in public policies , enhancing cooperation between the government and the Legislative Council , carrying out constitutional review seriously and carefully .
The Department of Justice will participate in all of the above work to ensure that all the government measures conform with laws and procedures , especially with the Basic Law , including the basic rights and freedom of citizens it guarantees . At the same time , it will keep alert , as a parliament member , Margaret NG mentioned , and safeguard the independence of legality and judicature in Hong Kong .
As a chief official , I will do my best to solicit ideas and criticisms from the public and people in the legal circles on judicial affairs and issues of legal profession .
For an example , CEPA results from close cooperation between the government and the legal circles such as Bar Association , Law Society , Association of China Appointed Attesting Officers .
We have successfully included " Legal Service " into CEPA . It has become one of the open service trades on the mainland . It serves as a new platform for the cooperation in legal service and will bring about macro- and long-term benefits for both sides .
The work of the special responsibility group is two-way . We will inform the central government about our work in listening to the public opinions of Hong Kong .
From mid-January to the present of this year we have interviewed more than 10 organizations and persons .
All the interviewees accept the concept without reservation that the constitutional development of Hong Kong should conform to " one country two systems " and the Hong Kong Special Administration Region is directly under the jurisdiction of the central government .
The majority of them think that the political system of Hong Kong needs improvement . However , at the same time they also accept the idea that any development should be in conformity with the Basic Law .
The organizations and persons have their own ideas about some specific procedures and legal issues .
The special responsibility group will submit all their wishes , ideas and proposals wholly and entirely to the central government .
In the forthcoming month the special responsibility group will continue to interview organizations and persons and to submit the ideas and opinions of the interviewees to the central government .
This is the first meeting between the special responsibility group and the relevant departments of the central government . In the future we still need more contacts and communication with the central government .
I believe everyone knows that the constitutional development is related to the relationship between the central government and the Administration Special Region . The central government has constitutional right to examine the constitutional development of the Administration Special Region . We need to have full consultation with the central government .
West Kowloon Culture & Entertainment District , an unprecedented large cultural and art program in Hong Kong , will not only provide room for residents to engage in cultural , art and entertainment activities but also help to promote the qualities of the residents and the metropolis .
The construction of West Kowloon Cultural & Entertainment District belongs to the whole Hong Kong society .
The government must continue to study the project with all social circles so as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas .
We understand that we cannot afford to pursue beauty and magnificence of the building only , it must be of economic benefits , be able to develop in a sustained way and help promote the quality of the residents ' livelihood .
Therefore , the government attaches special attention to the software complements of West Kowloon Cultural & Entertainment District . There must be corresponding measures , including the managing policies of the facilities , the publicity strategy of the cultural and art programs , the contents of the performances and exhibitions , the publicity strategy , etc .
Ideas of " users " should be carefully listened to before these strategies are worked out .
The younger generation , including every youngster present here , will be one of the users of West Kowloon Cultural & Entertainment District .
We hope that the District will be good for people of all ages and for both refined and popular tastes . It should be appealing for both Hong Kong residents and the tourists from outside , for both the matured generation and the vigorous youth .
I know you had discussions this morning on different categories of West Kowloon Cultural & Entertainment District . Some of the students have made painstaking efforts and prepared special reports . I believe you are very familiar with the detailed data of the project .
I am eager to hear the results of your discussions and to have a chance to exchange ideas with you .
Since the September 11 terrorist attack the world attention is focused on the security of ports , airports and borders .
As the first largest port that sends the greatest number of containers to the USA , Hong Kong undoubtedly made prompt response to the " container security initiative " raised by US .
Besides , we believe to cut off the lifeline of terrorist organizations is an effective way to check terrorist activities .
Large sums of money circulating in the global financial system every day has been perplexing for law-enforcing agencies aiming at benefits of crimes and cleaning up dirty money .
As the important financial center in Asia , we believe to cut off money supply for terrorists may be the most effective way to deal a deadly blow to their structure .
Presently , the Hong Kong Legislation is considering proposals for improvement so as make present laws and regulations more effective in cracking down on activities of providing financial aid to terrorists . At the same time it gives active cooperation with international standards and situation , e.g. new proposal for setting up a special department to annihilate cleaning up dirty money , amending laws , etc .
Besides , we are preparing perfect data release legal cases so as to facilitate related agencies and personnel in reporting suspected transactions .
" Balance " is the key to the work in this regard . Effective investigation power , constitution-protected freedom and privacy and the efficiency of economic and financial systems are all the factors that must be taken into account .
Our control measures are based on legality , degree of openness , fairness and efficiency .
As a matter fact Hong Kong 's service trade enjoys advantages in many aspects .
Professional and commercial service talents in Hong Kong have profound knowledge about the international commercial operation and the commercial operation on the mainland .
Hong Kong 's services in accounting , finance , law and arbitration are best partners of mainland enterprises which are being internationalized and are trying to adapt themselves to international standards and conventions .
And our transport , architecture , design , publicity of market affairs , management counseling , information technology , conference , exhibition and other services are conducive to promoting the overall competitive and productive powers of mainland enterprises and help the enterprises and their products to work out marketing strategies and to promote their brand name images .
For tourism , medical care , insurance and other services are even more helpful in promoting the development of related markets and trades on the mainland and in raising their service level .
The close cooperation in service trades between the two places will greatly help increase their respective advantages and jointly face various opportunities and challenges brought about by economic globalization .
To promote the development of our professional services on the mainland , Secretary of the Department of Finance and I , together with officials from the Policy Bureau and the Execution Commission and representatives from different trades , held substantial and valuable discussions in Beijing last week with our counterpart departments and institutions on the mainland on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other issues of common concern .
I am happy to see the conclusion of agreements of qualification mutual recognition and cooperation in the 3 professional services of architecture , structure engineering and insurance . This is an important step for Hong Kong services to seek development on the mainland .
Through this conference the professional organization of Hong Kong has forged closer ties with the control and management agencies of mainland , laying a positive foundation for the next stage of the friendly cooperation .
I am confident that the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents love their motherland and Hong Kong .
The links and relations between mainland and Hong Kong in economy , society , politics and culture have always been close and closely bound up either before or after Hong Kong 's return to China .
In terms of economy we see that Hong Kong industry has had chance to shift northwards and has had new room for development since China began to launch its four modernization , reform and opening up over twenty years ago . This has drawn closer the relationship between mainland and the Hong Kong society .
Recently we have further chance to make arrangements for closer trade links with the central government so that various service trades in Hong Kong will have new opportunities to participate in the mainland economic development in a more active and more extensive manner and do more things for our motherland and for Hong Kong . This will draw closer the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland .
In terms of social progress we have seen in recent years that the country is advancing with gigantic strides .
Hong Kong residents leapt with joy when seeing the successful bid of Beijing to host 2008 Olympic Games .
A few months ago , Mr. Yang Liwei visited Hong Kong and Hong Kong people also leapt with joy . Why ?
Because we feel that our country has scored such a success enough to make everyone , every Hong Kong residents to feel proud .
I know the Legislative Council began to discuss with the government about the issue of long-term office of the legislature as early as 10 years ago .
In the meanwhile the government has been always considering a long-term plan for the relocation of the government headquarters after the past 10 years .
Therefore I understand that the government decision to postponed the relocation project including the Timar Development Project of the new office building of the Legislative Council will surely disappoint some of legislative council members .
I know the legislative council members will have to suffer from many inconveniences and work in places of poor condition during this period .
However , just as I told my government colleagues who are affected by the decision , I hope that everyone will put the interest of the public in the first place , get to know the situation and put up with it in this period .
Some time ago I explained several times to the Administrative Committee of the Legislative Council that the government thought it was not the right time to carry out the Timar Project or the project of a large office building , after giving consideration to the present financial situation and the financial status after the outbreak of SARS .
To put off the project of a new legislative building located at Timar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government for the next couple of years , is in conformity with the public interest and is accepted by the public .
The government will , as soon as the financial situation improves , start the new legislative building project located at Timar . We will do this according to our present plan .
The state cares for Hong Kong very much and the President and the Premier show great concern for Hong Kong . I believe they and the central government will do their utmost to do good job in this regard .
Therefore , good tidings will keep coming in such service trades as tourism , finance , coordination of infrastructure construction , traffic rights , product zero tariffs , etc .
I also do hope that Hong Kong will contribute more to the development of the country by making more and better use of its advantages , as Hong Kong economy recovers .
When I met with Premier Wen Jiabao , I congratulated him , on behalf of Hong Kong , on the gratifying achievements scored by the state under his leadership in the past difficult year . Although the future is filled with challenges , he is fully confident as everyone of you has heard in his work report . We feel deeply encouraged by this .
Premier Wen also told me that , by refreshing our minds with the important statement of " one country two systems " made by Mr. Deng Xianping 20 years ago , we will have an overall and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country two systems " and we will find it very significant and very conducive to the future development of the constitution .
He also told me that Hong Kong people should seize the opportunity and concentrate on economic development and the people 's livelihood . He has full confidence in Hong Kong .
Not long afterwards I met with Mr. Zhang Dejiang , Party Secretary of Guangdong Province , and Mr. Huang Huahua , Governor of Guangdong Province and had discussions with them on how to promote our cooperation from the present basis to a higher level and how to create a larger win-win situation .
The last point is " Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong " which has become very familiar with all of us recently . The system requires that Hong Kong be administered by Hong Kong people whose main body consists of patriots .
Patriots are judged by clear criteria . They must respect their own nation , sincerely support the state to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and never do anything harmful to the state and Hong Kong . Such people are patriots and constitute the main body of Hong Kong people that administer Hong Kong .
I have to reiterate that Hong Kong people as a whole are patriotic .
Here I do not refer to the ordinary Hong Kong residents , but to those people who participate in the administration of public affairs in Hong Kong , that is , those high-level personnel in administrative structure , in the legislature and the judiciary organs .
When taking an oath of office , they should declare their support of the Basic Law of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with the Basic Law and swear to be loyal to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China .
The 5 to 6 principles and important considerations mentioned above were actually recognized as long-term policies in 1980s when the long-term future of Hong Kong was being discussed and the " Joint Declaration " and the Basic Law were being drawn out . They have remained unchanged and will never change , for they are the long-term policies since the state resumed its sovereignty over Hong Kong and they are basic policies of the state which will never change .
Since the birth of intellectual property system several hundred years ago , especially since the industrial revolution , important epoch-making inventions have come into being one after another .
In the past 20 years the intellectual property system has been an important legal system and a significant policy means in promoting technological innovations and has played a pivotal role in enlivening economy and enhancing international competitive power .
At present with the development of scince and technology and economic globalization by leaps and bounds , creation , possession and utilization of knowledge and intellectual resources , quantities and quality of the possessed intellectual property have become important basis for a country to participate in international competition .
Therefore , to intensify the international exchange and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property is of great significance for establishing a just and reasonable new international economic order and for promoting the prosperity and growth of world economy .
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property .
In the early days of reform and opening-up , our country began to set up an intellectual property system . Over 20 years of endeavor it has already formed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property and has forged a protection system of such rights which combines judiciary means with administrative execution of laws . Lots of work has been done in this regard and we have made important contribution to the progress of science and technology and the development of society and economy .
In the 21st century humankind enters a society of information . The technological revolution will propel the development of social productive forces with tremendous driving force .
To further improve the intellectual property system of our country and intensify international exchange and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property are the requirements of the further opening-up to the outside world of our country in the new century , and are also the necessity for building a modern socialist country and achieving the great renewal of the Chinese nation .
We are willing to work together with other countries in the world in order to establish a just and reasonable intellectual property system conducive to promoting the development of technology and economy in all countries and to create a good environment in which the whole humankind respects knowledge , advocates science and protects intellectual property .
Currently , the first most important task confronting Shanghai Cooperation Organization is to speedup the mechanism construction of the organization .
Through the efforts of various parties , great progress has been made in the preparation for the establishment of its secretariat and regional anti-terror organ .
We will make persistent efforts to make sure that the secretariat will start to operate within this year and the regional anti-terror organ will be set up as soon as possible .
To display the highest attention for Shanghai Cooperation Organization , the Chinese government as the host country of the secretariat will provide the secretariat with offices free of charge .
In the future we will continue to give energetic support so that the secretariat may work smoothly .
It has always been the focus of the work of Shanghai Cooperation Organization to deepen and expand the security cooperation .
As for the " 3 gangs of forces " which threaten the interest of the member countries , we will never relax our vigilance and will never appease or tolerate them .
We should work hard ceaselessly to eradicate such forces to ensure peace and stability of the region .
To cut off the financial supply for " the 3 gangs of forces " and crack down on them more extensively and effectively , we should put the anti-drug issue on the agenda of security cooperation as soon as possible .
Economic cooperation is the basis and the priority orientation of Shanghai Cooperation Organization .
Education serves as the foundation stone of modern civilization .
Educational cause must be developed on a large scale if we wish to promote the qualities of our people and increase the overall national strength .
The rural education has extensive influence . It has a bearing on the rural economy and the development of the whole society .
Great changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas since reform and opening-up started . This is closely associated with education , especially rural education .
The implementation of the household contract responsibility system in the countryside greatly emancipated the productive forces .
One of the fundamental reasons why advanced practical technology has been successfully applied on large areas , why rural enterprises have developed vigorously and why surplus labor force from rural areas has migrated in large number to coastal regions and cities and towns lies in the fact that hundreds of millions of rural laborers who have completed their compulsory education serve as the foundation and support . The popularization of compulsory education in the countryside has scored great achievements which can not be ignored .
Presently , the agriculture and rural economy of our country are at a key developing moment . The development of quality , efficient , ecological and safe agriculture , the expansion of management of agricultural industrialization , the transfer of rural surplus labor force , etc. all call for the overall promotion of qualities of rural laborers .
The rise of the new technological revolution in the world and the drive to build a well-off society in a comprehensive way set higher demands for the scientific and cultural qualities and the ideological morals of the rural population .
An overall well-off society is impossible without the popularization of the 9-year compulsory education in the countryside and without the overall promotion of qualities of peasants .
We must be fully aware of the basic , leading and comprehensive role of the rural education in the building of an overall well-to-do society .
Advisors and distinguished guests attending the meeting include senior executives of transnational corporations , economic experts of international stature and scholars of great attainments .
I am deeply impressed by the sincere cooperative spirit and practical attitude of the advisors .
To bring into full play our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom not only benefits the planning and promotion of Guangdong development but also is conducive to enhancing the cooperation and development between us in various fields .
I have been looking forward to the convening of 2003 Guandong International Advisory Conference on Economy and Development so that I could hear and get to know your real and penetrating views about the economic and social development of Guangdong Province .
We gather here today with but one aim , i.e. to strengthen our cooperation and exchange , to expand room for development , to add vigor to the economic and social development in Guangdong , and also to create opportunities for the advancement of your careers .
China 's entry into WTO marks an entirely new phase of opening up to the outside world . We are participating in the international competition on a larger scope , in wider fields and on a higher level .
Guangdong , a province on the mainland with the highest level of opening to the outside in economy , has led China in experiencing the unprecedented developing opportunities and severe challenges .
Against such a large background , we must firmly seize the new opportunity , meet the new challenge , increase the overall international competitive power , promote the modernization actively , work hard to score new achievements in economic cooperation , and to achieve mutual complement of advantages , mutual benefits , long-term cooperation and joint development .
Guangdong people are concentrating their efforts in building an all-round well-off society and speeding up their pace of modernization . This will provide more opportunities and more room of development for all our friends .
The Guangdong economy , with great vigor and bright prospects , is marching to a new high with a dynamic stance .
A few days ago , the Provisional Governing Council of Iraq and the US occupying authorities concluded an agreement in Baghdad , announcing a schedule of returning power to Iraq by June next year step by step .
This agreement is recognized and accepted by the international community with some reservation . Although the foreign minister of EU expressed his welcome , France thinks " the process is too slow " . While the UN Secretary General Annan " feels encouraged " by the plan of turning over the power , Meanwhile , he indicates that " time is not mature " for UN to play its role in Iraq . Russia simply doubts the legality of the agreement .
The Iraqi public are apathetic in response . The US public opinion even believes " it is a great gamble . "
In short people half believe and half doubt it . They adopt a " wait-and-see " attitude .
It is not without reason that the international community is dubious about it .
Because people see that handing over the power is something US has to do , the power transfer can never be complete , which will inevitably leave behind many foreshadowing .
First , the interim transitional government to be established by May next year will not be directly elected by the Iraqi people , but by " the transitional national congress " which will be elected by 18 provincial election committees .
This can hardly avoid the suspicion that US controls the whole process . Its legality will be doubted .
Secondly , US has announced that the US troops will not withdraw after the handover . They will only replace " military occupation " with " military presence " .
The American government announced on November 18 that it imposes quota limit on 3 imported Chinese fabrics of knit fabrics , bras and dressing gowns .
At a time when China is making persistent efforts to promote the Sino-American trade cooperation , this trade protectionism measure by US is unavoidably disappointing .
Today when economic globalization is progressing fast , the reimposing of limit on Chinese textiles by the US government is out of accord with the times .
First , this abuse of " quota " measure hinders the implementation of the WTO principle of free trade .
Talking in a high-sounding way about " free trade " on the one hand , US resorts to underhand means by imposing " quotas " and builds the trade barrier again . Does it not seem too arbitrary and unfair ?
Secondly , the " quota " hinders the positive development of the Sino-American economic and trade relations .
Since China and US arrived at an agreement about China 's accession to WTO in 1999 , the American export to China has grown by 15 % each year on an average .
From January to September this year the American export to China grew by 26.2 % compared with the same period last year .
In the past 2 years the American export of textile raw materials and finished products to China grew by a big margin .
In fact today 's China is the one to which the US export grows fastest in the world .
Bush failed to achieve his purpose in visiting Britain . There are many reasons for this . The most important reason is that US became the sole super-power after the cold war was over . It regards all the other countries as insignificant and its unilateralism keeps expanding .
US , without being authorized by UN , launched the war against Iraq . It does not respect the opinions of its main allies on important international issues like the reconstruction of Iraq . It enrages most of the countries by doing things at its own will .
A public opinion poll released by the Commission of the European Communities shows that 68 % of the EU citizens do not think US had ample reason to launch the Iraq war and 53 % believe that US has posed a threat to world peace .
Secondly , US stresses the importance of fighting against terrorism and demands its allies to contribute troops and money . But it ignores the issues of their concern .
The US takes a tight control of the reconstruction projects of Iraq . It granted the major projects of the first bidding to the companies of its own country and refused to share . As for the dispute over steel trade , the WTO has made its arbitrary decision that the US high tariff has violated the rules . The British business circles wished Bush to yield , but he did not give an explicit answer in the end .
Thirdly , US imposes the values of its own country on others as the highest principles and insists on democratic transformation of the Middle East countries . This has met with opposition and some of its allies demand US to respect the culture and characteristics of the Islamic countries . They think that the reason why US troops are caught in the quagmire of Iraq lies in its " failure to respect " it .
However , Bush won 't change because of extensive criticism and opposition . During his visit he defended his policies towards Iraq once again and emphasized that US and British coalition forces would deal with violence incidents with military force .
Since Bush did not fulfil his wish in this visit , the Iraqi situation will not necessarily develop as the White House wishes .
After a dispute as long as half a year , the advance unit of Japan Self Defense Forces finally left for Iraq at the end of 2003 .
This is the first time after the Second World War for Japan to send its troops overseas .
It reflects the will of Japan to become a political and military power . It also indicates a change of the defense strategy of Japan .
The reason why this movement of Japan Self Defense Forces is conspicuous is that it is not an isolated event .
Taking advantage of the Afghani war , Japan made a breakthrough in sending its Self Defense Forces to other countries . Also by taking advantage of the Korean Peninsula issue , Japan passed " Emergency Legislation " which leaves foreshadowing for the Self Defense Forces to take pre-emptive actions . Recently Koizumi 's Cabinet has passed " the Essential Plan of Assisting Iraq Reconstruction Projects , " which leaves foreshadowing for sending the soldiers to Iraq .
Step by step Japan has broken through the limit set by Japan 's peace constitution and has sent its troops to the overseas battlefields .
Besides , Japan is planning to revise the " Nation 's Basic Defense Framework " in 2004 so as to make its sending troops overseas legalized and permanent . It also plans to establish a non-provisional " permanent troops " for the purpose of operation in other countries .
At the same time the Japanese cabinet , on the pretext of the so-called " North Korean missile threat " , has made the decision to start mapping out its missile defensive system in early 2004 . It has also introduced from US the " standard missile-3 " and the " patriot missile-3 " in order to intercept those missiles outside or returning to atmosphere . So a double missile intercepting network has been formed .
It is not difficult to figure out that Japan Self Defense Forces is developing towards a regular army which " combines offence with defense " . The " Self Defense Forces " which " is solely engaged in defense " will cease to exist except in name .
These acts of Japan are noticeable primarily because these military decisions are great impact on Japan 's peace constitution .
Koizumi was interviewed by Japanese journalists after visiting Yasukuni Shrine and tried to justify his act .
His explanation is self-contradictory and does not hold water .
When asked by the journalists why he visited the Yasukuni Shrine , Koizumi answered : " Japan 's peace and prosperity is realized on the basis of war victims .
My visit is to appeal for Japan 's peace and prosperity . "
Let 's ask Koizumi whether or not the so-called " war victims " included such first-class war criminals as Hideki Tojo ?
Could it be said that the post-war peace and prosperity in Japan was also including the contribution on the basis of first-class war criminals ?
Some journalist asked him why he chose January 1 to visit the Shrine ?
Koizumi answered that it is a tradition in Japan to visit the Shrine on January 1 . Many people visit the Shrine on this day .
It is understandable that common people mourn over the death of their relatives and friends . And many mourners explicitly say that their visit is to mourn their deceased relatives and friends and they are opposed to enshrining and worshipping first-class war criminals at Yasukuni Shrine .
The Chinese people are reasonable . We have always insisted that Japanese people should be separated from a few militarists and the common people should be differentiated from right-wingers . The visit of Yasukuni Shrine by the common people is not the crux of the historical problems .
Unity is strength .
This is an irrefutable truth .
To realize the grand goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way and to complete the sacred cause of the renaissance of the Chinese nation , we must unite with all the forces that can be united .
The work of the patriotic united front and the people 's political consultative at the new stage of the new century must have this as their point of departure and point of conclusion .
We must persist in and continue to improve the multi-party cooperation and political consultative system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front and mobilize all the positive factors in the most extensive manner and to the fullest extent , so as to keep adding new forces to the great renaissance of the Chinese nation .
In the past year the People 's Political Consultative Conference , firmly seizing the two themes of unity and democracy , earnestly performed its various function and played an important role in promoting our country 's economic and social progress and in maintaining the stability of reform and development .
In the new year we hope that the People 's Political Consultative Conference will , centering close on the central task of the Party and the state , continue to do a good job in political consultation , democratic supervision and participation in the administration and discussion of the state affairs , carry on in-depth investigation by bringing its own advantages into full play , offer advice and suggestions and make more contribution to the drive of building an all-round well-off society .
From January 4th to 6th , the 12th Summit of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) which had been delayed for a whole year was convened in Islamabad , The Summit adopted such documents as " Framework Agreement on South Asia Free Trade Area " , " Additional Protocol to the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism " , " SAARC Social Charter " , etc . They made it public that the countries of SAARC will be committed to joint development and cooperation in such fields as economy , culture , the fight against terrorism , etc .
During the Summit the meeting between the Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and the Pakistani President Musharraf was especially conspicuous .
At the last summit , people did not expect much about the relations between the two countries when they saw the handshake between Musharraf and Vajpayee .
After two years , the tension between the 2 countries keeps relaxing and the highest level meeting between them at last took place at the Summit due to a series of important measures like normalization of their diplomatic relation , resumption of air and land communication , the cease fire in Kashmir region , etc .
A stride has been taken by the 2 countries in improving their bilateral relations . The cooperation in South Asian region is greeting a new turn for the better .
Although the Indian Foreign Minister Sinha said on 4th that the meeting was " courtesy " , people believe that the India-Pakistan relationship keeps being adjusted to be more positive and more practical .
Leaders of the 2 countries have come to realize that tension and conflict do not conform to the interest of their countries and instead make them lose one opportunity after another for economic development .
With the further development of economic globalization , to strengthen cooperation and vitalize economy has become the pressing matter of the moment for the 2 countries .
Although the result of the Georgian president election held on 4th has not been made public , the victory of National Movement Party leader and the candidate jointly recommended by right-wing parties Saakashvili is already a foregone conclusion .
The Georgian Central Election Committee announced on 7th that the statistics of 89 % of ballots shows that 95 % of the voters support Saakashvili .
State heads of some CIS countries have already sent congratulation messages to this young statesman .
In fact on the very night when the election was over , Saakashvili already announced himself to be the winner .
He called the result " a victory of the people " and said the Georgia will take prompt action to create new prospects .
Many voters say , when interviewed by news media , that the ballots cast to Saakashvili mean the choice of " new hope " .
Even Shevardnadze , former president who was compelled to resign , expressed his support for his political opponent , praising him to be " young , vigorous and well educated " .
While placing hope on him , people also notice that the situation in Georgia has not changed much in the 2 months since Shevardnadze resigned .
It may well say that the newly elected president will meet the same old problems .
The past year was an important and unusual year in the course of the development of our country .
We carried out an extremely hard and bitter struggle against SARS which took us by surprise and scored phasic victory . Our economy kept growing and the per capital GDP exceeded 1,000 USD , which marks a new stage . Shenzhou 5 successfully completed a manned spaceflight , materializing the dream of the Chinese nation to fly to the space . The whole nation is united , society is progressing and people 's livelihood keeps improving .
In achieving the remarkable successes in various fields , the Chinese people have done painstaking work and displayed great courage and strength and the undaunting spirit in face of difficulties .
Looking forward to the new year we are full of confidence and hope .
Judging from the world and domestic situation , we are now at an important moment of strategic opportunity which we must firmly seize and in which we can achieve a lot .
We should persist in guiding our work with the important thought of " three represents " put forward by Deng Xiaoping , implement in an all-round way the decisions made at the 16th National Party Congress and its 3rd Plenary Session , put into practice the important policies and overall arrangements worked put by the Party Central Committee for the work of this year and continue to promote reform , opening-up and the construction of modernization .
To do a good job of this year 's work we must have the right judgement of the situation and see not only favorable conditions and new opportunities but also unfavorable conditions and new challenges . We must enhance our sense of responsibility , sense of urgency and awareness of difficulties and danger ahead .
The 3-party talk on Iraqi issue was held at the New York UN headquarters on 19 . The UN Secretary General Annan , Provisional Governing Council of Iraq and the Interim Authority of the British and US coalition forces had a discussion mainly on how UN plays its role in the reconstruction of Iraq .
The discussion involves the politics , humanity and security of Iraq and the special envoy to be sent to Iraq by UN . The 3 parties had a frank exchange of views .
The plan of Britain and America to hand over power in Iraq is facing resistance . It naturally arrests the attention of the world whether or not and how UN will play its part in the cause of Iraq reconstruction .
Since early May last year US declared the main military operations in Iraq were over , the situation in the country has been keeping shaky and unstable . The anti-occupation attacks popped up one after another , causing great casualties of the US-British coalition troops and unpeaceful everyday .
The former Iraqi President Saddam was caught on December 13 last year , but the US rapture did not last long and the security situation was not improved . The intensified activities of the resistance movement put the occupying authorities in a dilemma .
On the other hand the Iraqi public and the Arab countries unanimously demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and returning of power to Iraqi people so that the Iraqi people can run their own country .
In the meanwhile US and Britain try hard to remold Iraq according to their will and thence get out of this quagmire " in a dignified way " .
Therefore , the way and process of the handover has become the focus of present Iraqi issues .
The handover proposal jointly put forward by the US-British authorities and the Provisional Governing Council of Iraq is like this : a provisional and transitional government should be formed before July 1 this year through election by " transitional National Congress " , but the deputies to attend the Congress shall be appointed by " provincial election committees " .
But the Shiahs who constitute the majority of the Iraqi population stress that direct general election should be held to return power to the Iraqi people in a really fair manner .
The recent visit to Russia by the US Secretary of State Powell is still the focus of attention of public opinions .
One reason is that US and Russia are powers that play decisive roles in the world and their relation has profound influence on world issues .
What 's more important is that Powell 's visit to Moscow has substantial content and sends a clear signal : the sky of Russia-American relations is overcast .
If the dark clouds are not dispelled , the relationship between the 2 countries will become gloomy .
Although the dialogue channel between Washington and Moscow is open and unimpeded , Powell has decided to clarify his stand by publishing an article on " Information " , a very influential newspaper in Moscow .
In the article Powell points out that US feels perplexed at a series of events in the fields of Russian internal affairs and diplomacy .
He thinks that the Russian political power is not checked by law and such key elements of a citizen society as press freedom and development of political parties are not fixed enough .
The Russian policy towards Chechnya and its attitude to the neighboring countries of CIS worries US even more .
In the eyes of diplomats it is the " last resort " of information communication to openly express his views through mass media .
The purpose of such a decision by US affords food for thought . It is evident that Russia feels embarrassed and unhappy about this .
After the world entered the new century , African countries were confronted by an important and serious challenge because of economic globalization .
Leaders of African countries have come to realize more and more clearly that Africa cannot afford to let slip the excellent opportunity and should start immediately to find policies and measures to deal with it .
On July 9th , 2002 the African Union was formally set up and began to work . From then on African countries , on the one hand , began to actively implement " the New Partnership for Africa 's Development " , worked hard to develop economy and strive to get rid of the unfavorable plight in economic globalization as soon as possible . On the other hand they made special efforts to settle the issues of armed conflicts - a main obstacle to the renaissance cause of Africa so as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .
The general situation in Africa at present is relaxing and the hot spot issues are cooling down . The countries are more and more eager to put an end to the armed conflicts .
Backed up by UN and the international community , the influential regional organization in Africa , the regional powers and famous statesmen have taken positive actions and stepped up their efforts in settling regional conflicts and removing internal turmoil . Some conflicts and turmoil which lasted for years have been basically brought under control .
For instance a national unity government was set up in Congo ( Kinshasa ) in June last year ; in July Sao Tome and Principe solved the coup d 'etat crisis with peaceful means ; in August the Libyan government signed a peace accord with the anti-government armed forces in the Ghana capital of Accra ; in September the Sudanese government began a key talk with the anti-government forces in the south , which broke the deadlock of the peace process ; in October the various armed and political factions in Somalia began their peace talk in Kenya and talked about the nationwide peace process ; in November the Burundi government signed a peace accord with the anti-government troops ; etc .
Of course the stability in Africa at present is still fragile and the fruits of peace need to be consolidated . Some potential and existing armed conflicts are to be finally settled .
At the same time there is still a great gap between African countries and developing countries in Asia and other continents in terms of the speed of economic development . These are the unfavorable elements for African development .
How to deal with the challenges of economic globalization effectively in African countries and realize the African dream of renaissance , the African people have to make long-term and arduous endeavor .
Recently , highly infectious epidemic cases of bird flu erupted one after another in some regions of our country .
The Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to this and have promptly made a series of important decisions , explicitly putting forward guidelines and policy measure for the work of prevention .
The local government and relevant departments immediately go into action to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the plan and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council .
Presently , the national prevention of bird flue is going on at a quick pace and in an orderly way .
The bird flue is a fast-spreading and very harmful animal disease which harms animal husbandry greatly and poses a great threat the health and safety of the people .
To effectively prevent and cure the highly infectious bird flue has a bearing on the health and safety of the broad masses , on the agricultural development and the income increase of peasants , on the economic development of the whole nation and on social stability . The local governments and relevant departments should , guided by the important thought of " 3 represents " and in accordance with " Law of the People 's Republic of China on Prevention of Animal Epidemics " , strengthen leadership and coordination , mobilize the people in scientific and legal prevention campaign , take actions without hesitation , carry out all preventive measures to the letter with the spirit of responsibility to the people and finally win the blocking action of bird flue prevention .
As the biggest debtor country , US has additional amount to its debt .
The US Department of Finance announced on January 16 that by the end of September last year the total amount of debt America owed foreign creditors had added up to 6,494,000 million USD , a 2.2 % growth over the figure published last time .
On an average , every American has a foreign debt of 20,000 USD .
What a coinsidence was that a week before it the International Monetary Fund had given a systematic and pointed warning to the tottering base of the US finance in a research report . It also pointed out that the US external debt which has kept breaking records poses a threat to the stability of world finance .
Statistics indicate that foreign private investors have controlled 40 % of the US government bonds .
It reminds people of the first half of the 20th century when Keynes proposed the following stratagem to Roosvelt : if economy is stimulated at home by deficit policy , the financial deficits can be solved by borrowing money from outside .
This stratagem really played an important role in setting the matter of extreme urgency of economic crisis by stimulating " effective demands " .
However , people have noticed that several US administrations have tended to use this as " a miraculous cure " .
Since President Reagan advocated tax reduction and arms expansion in 1980s , the American financial deficit has kept growing and finally US has become the biggest debtor nation .
The first round of the 6-party talk is an important step in the process of the peaceful setting the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula .
The common points concluded by the parties in the talk have laid a necessary foundation for the continuation of the talk and outlined more goals , approaches and policies for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula .
In recent months the parties concerned persisted in peaceful settlement of the unclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through dialogues . On the basis of the results of the first round of talks , consultations and discussions at various levels were extensively held and persistent efforts were made for holding the second round of talks as soon as possible .
In the meanwhile North Korea and US displayed further flexibility of different degrees .
Important progress has been made in preparations of the talk . It is the common wish of all countries that the talk will be held successfully .
It is the general concern of all parties and the international community whether or not the talk will continue and what results the talk will achieve .
In this aspect the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the aim of the 6-party talk is to maintain and promote the process of peaceful settlement through dialogues . We are ready to work together with other parties for this purpose .
The basic starting point of the Chinese party is to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve nuclear-free there .
The Chinese party believes that so long as the parties persist in sincerity of peace talks , respect each other and negotiate on equal basis , favorable conditions can be created for promoting the settlement of the relevant issues .
In the end of 70s of the last century the relation between US and Libya worsened . And in 1981 their diplomatic relations broke off .
American President Reagan listed a series of crimes for the Libya President Qaddafi , e.g. accusing Libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons , conducting military interference and terrorism in other countries etc .
The oral disputes turn into armed confrontation and US launched 2 surgical air attacks entitled " Prairie Fire " and " El Dorado Canyon " .
Afterwards , US imposed economic sanction against Libya , attacked it in politics , contained it in diplomacy and threatened it with arms .
But Qaddafi refused to give in though under great pressure .
Presently , the relationship between US and Libya is warming up . Some people attribute this entirely to the threat effects of Iraqi War , but this seems to be biased .
In fact , for years Qaddafi of unique personality has been opposed to US on the one hand and kept stretching the olive branch to US which however received no response on the other hand .
After the Iraqi War was over , the countries in the Middle East readjusted their strategies and the regional forces regrouped themselves . This provides a good opportunity for US and Libya to renew the diplomatic relation .
For Qaddafi to mend its relations with US will put an end to the sanctions , revive its economy , improve people 's livelihood , get rid of isolation and integrate into the world community .
The give-up by Libya of what has not been obtained and will not be obtained in the near future can be reciprocated by a new environment  a sudden glimpse of hope in the dark .
From February 7th to 8th the political celebrities from Europe , America and other world regions gathered in Munich , Germany to attend the 40th Munich Conference on Security Policy .
The so-called " Munich Conference on Security Policy " , founded by non-governmental persons of Germany and financially aided by the German Government , is a forum on international security issues . In recent years , especially since " September 11 " , it has received increasingly more attention and is lauded as " Davos Forum " in the security field .
An important item on the agenda of the meeting is the trans-atlantic relations .
The European and American political figures said at or after the conference that the two sides are striving to remove the shadow from the relations between the two sides brought about by the Iraqi War and are working hard to return to the track of cooperation .
Bertram , director of Berlin Institute for International Politics and Security , said this is a meeting to mend the relations between Europe and America and both sides wish to draw close .
In terms of Europe-American relations , good news from the Conference goes that Europe and America need to resume dialogues , to give careful consideration to the common tasks confronting the two sides and to find the interest converging point needed for the accomplishment of these common tasks .
Compared with the Conference held last year , this year 's session is free from the smell of gunpowder and the position of the two sides come closer .
The " Old Europe " represented by France and Germany , though still brood on the Iraqi War launched by US , says that they will " look forward " .
The German Foreign Minister Fischer said at the Conference : Although we hold different views about the war , we must jointly ensure that peace is achieved in the post-war Iraq . For this we must look forward .
He also remarked that Germany will not block NATO from playing a direct role in Iraq although it won 't send any troops to Iraq .
US which leads the world in medium field has a lot to say in international press . Its tentacles of public opinion propaganda radiate to all over the world and there is no place they cannot reach . Then why does it spend so much money on a special satellite TV station covering 22 countries in the Middle East ?
Just as the responsible person of " First Freedom TV " station put it , it aims to provide a press platform with " all-round and fair views " for the Arab countries .
But some analyst point out that " First Freedom TV " will be America 's strategic weapon to carry out cultural infiltration , cultural intrusion and psychological offence in Arab countries . It will be an important propaganda tool for US to reshape the Middle East and transform the Islamic world .
Judging from this we see that " First Freedom TV " has unusual missions . Its chief missions are the following 3 . First , its mission is to spread " freedom concept " .
US believes that the Islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the western efforts in promoting modern civilization . The extreme religious forces in the Middle East Islamic countries are hotbed of international terrorism characteristic of opposing the USA . To effectively fight against terror , the Islamic world must be transformed so that it identifies with and accepts the western values , the western life style and the political system .
The US attempts to instill its ideology into Arabs through the imperceptible influence of " First Freedom TV " programs .
Secondly , it aims to improve the image of the USA .
US abides by unilateralism in its foreign policy . On many international issues it parades its strength and do things at its own will . Its hegemonic acts enrage the Arab countries and the Islamic world .
After the " September 11 " incident , the contradiction between US which has taken side with Israel and the Middle East Islamic world is being intensified .
US occupied Iraq with armed forces in the name of destroying weapons of mass destruction , without absolute evidence and the authorization from UN . This aroused strong disgust of the Moslem public .
The talk between Pakistani and Indian officials was held in Islamabad from February 16th to 18th . The hope of peace rose again on the south Asian subcontinent .
The officials of the 2 countries decided the schedule and agenda of the future talk and build up a mechanism for sustainable dialogues . This marks the restart of the Pakistan-Indian dialogue process after 2 years of suspension , laying a foundation for the settlement of all unsolved issues including Kashmir dispute . It embodies the valuable wish for peace of both sides .
Before this talk most of analysts hold cautious attitudes to the prospects of the peace process , although the relationship between the 2 countries had been warmed up by a series of good-will actions of both sides .
It is small wonder . Recalling the sudden rise and abrupt fall in the Pakistan-Indian relationship , nobody can guarantee that the sunshine on today 's talk table won 't turn into thunder and lightning on the border tomorrow .
However , the foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar of Pakistani State Council announced with a smile on 18 the joint statement of the 2 countries which immediately spread the optimistic mood all over the place . It made those who are concerned with the south Asian situation brighten up .
First of all the schedule determined for the talk is very feasible . The two sides not only clearly know the specific time and agenda of the talk but also different talk levels are decided in proportion to the importance of the specific topics .
Secondly , the directly dialogues between the leaders of the 2 countries brought the talk on failed during the Agra summit in July 2001 . The two sides draw a lesson from it and take the mode of dialogues by " step by step " . The talks level will be launched from low to high in order to prepare fully for the high level dialogues .
Thirdly , the two countries , after experiencing ups and downs in the relationship between the 2 countries , unanimously make it clear that war is not a good method to settle the conflict and both sides should keep away from war . This consensus has laid a good foundation for the future leaders of the 2 countries to reach an understanding of " no war forever between Pakistan and India . "
To accurately implement the policy of " one country , two systems " in an all-round way , we must integrate " one country " with " two systems " and " love for the motherland " with " love for Hong Kong " , unify the respect for high-level autonomy of Hong Kong with maintaining the state sovereignty and unify maintaining Hong Kong 's capitalism with socialism which insists on the state unity .
Only by doing this can the well-being of Hong Kong compatriots be maintained , which can conform to the long term interest of the state and the whole people .
After Hong Kong 's return , the central government has stuck to the implementation of the " one country two systems " policy and has strictly abided by the basic law in its work .
The broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots , as status of masters , enjoy unprecedented democratic rights .
With the powerful support of the central government and the mainland , Hong Kong subdued various risks and challenges such as the impact of the Asian financial crisis and has maintained its status as an international center of finance , trade and navigation .
Practice proves that the policy of " one country , two systems " has great vitality .
Today the speech made by Deng Xiaoping 20 years ago is published again , once again which demonstrates the strong determination of the central government in implementing the policy of " one country , two systems " . What 's more , it means to enable everyone to have an accurate and all-round understanding of the policy of " one country , two systems " and to keep promoting the great practice of the policy .
Today the Party Central Committee and the State Council solemnly hold this Awarding Ceremony of National Science and Technology .
President Hu Jingtao bestowed the 2003 national highest scientific and technological awards to two academicians of Liu Dongsheng and Wang Yongzhi .
The meeting also bestowed technological top grade award to the project " China Manned Spaceflight " and the natural science award , national technological invention award and national technological progress award in the year of 2003 to scientists and technologists .
I , on behalf of the Central Committee and the State Council , extend warm congratulations to all the laureates .
And our sincere greetings and highest respect to all the scientific and technological workers on all fronts .
The first 20 years of this century , for our country , is an important strategic period which we must firmly seize and in which we can achieve a lot .
We must concentrate on building a well-off society of a higher level which will benefit more than a billion people .
We should make best use of this period which is full of opportunies strategically and strive to achieve as much as we can . We must put the development of science and technology on an even more important and more prominent position .
After " September 11 " incident the American President Bush put forward the " pre-emptive " strategy in June 2002 and began to use it in the US foreign relations . And in March last year he fought the first " pre-emptive " war in Iraq .
The " pre-emptive " idea not only goes against the principle of international law which takes " mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity " as the kernel but also will inevitably give rise to the dangerous imitation effects . The international order will suffer new turmoil because of this .
In the early days when the " pre-emptive " theory was proposed , some American political celebrities asked this question : What if other countries follow the example ? "
As expected , more and more countries clamor to overwhelm others by " pre-emptive " means . The " pre-emptive " troops keep growing .
This is a new trend worth our attention and study .
In the very month when Bush put forward his " pre-emptive " strategy , the Prime Minister of Australia Howard was the first to voice his support .
He said that once we have reliable information about terrorist attack against Australia , Australia will adopt the " pre-emptive " strategy and will take military actions in the neighboring countries at all costs .
He even suggest that the " pre-emptive " principle be included into the UN Charter . He thinks it is necessary to make amendments to the UN Charter and give the right of " pre-emptive " attack to all countries so as to crack down on terrorists and those countries that support terrorist activities .
In northeast Asia the Japanese Ministry of Defense proposed as early as in July 1999 in its Defense White Paper that Japan may launch " pre-emptive " attacks against foreign bases when facing missile attack or before any military invasion .
After the Iraqi War , Japan 's cry for " pre-emptive " strategy has caused a clamor .
Recently , there have been many comments on America 's present policies towards Africa in international public opinions .
On America 's " Foreign Policy in Focus " published in January this year , there is an article entitled " Africa Policy Outlook 2004 " . The article holds that the foreign policies of Bush Administration in the past year have brought about direct or indirect negative influence on Africa . The full concerns of America were about the Anti-terrorist war and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially US was involved in Iraq , therefore , its attention to Afirica has been diverted much more .
People still remember that to display its concern for Africa , Bush Administration last year worked out " the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief " and promised to provide Africa with 3 billion USD at least each year .
In July last year Bush visited Senegal , South Africa , Botswana , Uganda and Nigeria and promised to assist African countries with 15 billion USD to prevent AIDS and 100 million USD to fight against terrorist activities . He also announced some assisting Africa programs including Emergency Food Assistance Plan and Education Aid Plan .
These assistance programs were once welcomed by African countries and won many international praises .
However , a year has passed and US has not shown any sign of implementing them .
Africa needs assistance badly .
After the world entered the new century , Africa faces various development challenges . In order to realize " the Century Development Goals " worked out by the UN in 2002 , i.e. to reduce hunger and poverty and promote health and education , Africa has set up its " African Union " whose mission it is to plan and coordinate African affairs in a unified way and has drawn up the " African New Partnership Program for Development " aiming to promote the development of the countries . But because of the weak economic basis , fund has always been in short supply .
UN has appealed many times to the developed countries to use 0.7 % of their GDP to provide official help to the least developed countries .
However , the American official aid accounts for only 0.1 % of its GDP , far below the UN demand . It is the last one on the list of the contributing countries .
Recently , there has been a hot topic discussed by the European public : Is the " 3 magnate " summit of German Prime Minister Schroeder , the French President Chirac and the British Prime Minister Blair going to be increasingly systematic and regular ?
Public opinion calls the " big three " of Germany , France and Britain " a new troika " of EU . The relationship of the 3 nations is called a " new triangle " affair .
" New triangle " is a new thing and we have to wait and see how it will develop . But whichever angle you judge it , " new triangle " in general is help for the process of European integration and for Europe to play its important role on the international arena as a pole of the multiple world .
A survey of the 100 year history of Europe will tell you that a basic characteristic of the German-France-British triangle is that British and France jointly contain and resist Germany .
The two world wars are the evidence .
During the cold war East and West Germany were sandwiched between the Warsaw Pact and NATO .
After the cold war is over , the unified Germany is stronger ; the power frame in west Europe is out of balance . France is more dubious and as a result the " German-France Axis " was once out of operation . Therefore Britain and France come closer with an intention still to contain Germany .
But in recent years , with the restart of the " German-France Axis " and the fierce conflicts between the ideas of world monopolarization and world multipolarization , great dissensions occurred inside EU over the Iraqi issue :
" The Old Europe " represented by Germany and France and " the New Europe " represented by Britain and Poland are poles apart in their stands on the Iraqi issue .
This split occurred accidentally at a time when EU is going to carry out its largest expansion in history .
Egyptian President Mubarak made a speech in Cairo a few days ago on the reform of Arab countries , criticizing the outside world for imposing one mode of reform on the Arab countries . He also warned that the attempt runs counter to its desire and is no conducive to the security and stability of the Middle East region .
He believes that reform measures should conform to the specific conditions and capabilities of the respective countries . A single reform mode ignores the cultural backgrounds , social customs and religious features of different countries .
At the same he points out that the Arab countries welcome outside help in their reform process , but this effort should recognize specific conditions of different countries and respect their wishes so as to promote the reform process of the Arab countries in politics , economy and culture .
The remarks of the Egyptian leader represent the common viewpoints of the Arab countries .
At present , under the pressure of anti-terror and anti-proliferation campaign and the democratic reform , the Middle East has become one of the hotspots of the world . New turmoil are brewing up ands they will lead to new regrouping .
After the Afghani and Iraqi Wars , how should Iraq , once considered by the US as " an axis of evil " , carry out political reconstruction ?
How will the various political bodies and social modes in the Middle East region evolve ?
This is the care and concern of not only the Arab World and the international community but also US and its western allies .
The American Secretary of State Powell reiterated in Washington on 9th when meeting with the Bahrain crown prince Salman , that US push forward " western democracy and capitalist plan " in Iraq and the Middle East .
He also emphasized : " We are considering what else we can do and how to systematize these . "
Last year was designated as " the year of culture and education " by the International Olympic Committee .
Taking advantage of this opportunity , Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the Olympiad sponsors a series of educational activities to spread advanced culture and popularize Olympic knowledge .
Of these activities , the publication of " Olympic Knowledge Reader for Middle School Pupils " basically for adolescents is an important result .
This reader , with vivid illustrations , mainly tells stories about Olympic Games and the substance of the Olympic spirit . It is a good textbook to promote the knowledge of adolescents on Olympic Games and to enhance the enthusiasm of the public in participating in Olympic activities .
Last year Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the Olympiad designed a school timetable exclusively for adolescent pupils which was made of recycled paper and the emblem of Beijing Olympic Games printed on them .
The concept of " Green Olympic " is to prepare and host the Olympic Games with the ideas of sustainable development such as environment protection and ecological balance preservation .
We hope that these timetables will normalize the behavior of adolescents just as they schedule the classes so that they gradually become advocators and practicers of the concept of " Green Olympic . "
Education , one of the essential contents of Olympic sports , is also an important embodiment of " people friendly Olympic " .
The real aim of the Olympic sports is to educate the young from a new angle and in a new manner , to promote the sound development of their bodies and minds and to contribute to the construction of a peaceful and beautiful world .
Therefore the combination of sports and education not only opens up new fields for educational development but also makes Olympic sports more educational .
" Green Olympic " is one of the 3 major concepts of 2008 Olympic Games to be hosted by Beijing .
The core is to improve the environment of the capital by a large margin so as to provide a fine surrounding for Olympic Games and build up an ecological city .
To achieve the purpose environmental protective technologies and means should be extensively adopted to boost the environment control , planting trees in the cities and countries and beautify them and development of environmental protective industries extensively and in an all-round way , to enhance the awareness of the environment of the whole society and to encourage the public to actively take part in ecological environment improvement .
To do a good job in the implementation of " Green Olympic " is one of our major tasks in implementing the decisions of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the CPC on maintaining a human-centered , comprehensive , well-coordinated and sustainable scientific concept of development and on promoting the all-round , coordinated and sustainable economic and social development in Beijing .
We must attach great importance to it .
To achieve the goals of green Olympic , Beijing Municipality has worked out " Olympic Action Plan " and " Plan for Ecological and Environmental Protection " in addition to the " 15th Five-Year Plan " and " Application Report " which set out new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .
The goal of hosting a green Olympic Games will be implemented in a planned and step-by-step way .
On February 25th the US State Departments issued its " Human Rights Watch World Report 2003 " which once again comments from head to feet on the human rights status in over 190 countries including China , lecturing others for the so-called poor conditions of human rights . It claims that some countries are not up to the US standards and others have retrogressed in the field of human rights , etc .
Of course there are countries that have made great improvement in human rights. e.g. Afghanistan and Iraq . But this is the " contribution and merit " of the US army which has overthrown the former governments and " liberated " the 2 countries .
What about the human rights in the USA ?
As in the past years the report is sparing of ink and makes no mention of it .
On March 1st the News Office of Chinese State Council published " 2003 Human Rights Record of the United States " , making up for the deficiency in the US Human Rights Report .
The Record , based on sufficient facts , gives an introduction to the existing problems of human rights in America and the US violation of other countries human rights .
The Americans have the tradition of sticking to honesty and admitting errors when they are made .
The well-known story about young George Washington cutting down a cherry tree is an example in point .
Today US has become the world sole superpower and on the contrary is not used to telling the truth .
Recently , subtle changes have taken place in the mainstream reports of Japan 's media on the economic development in China .
Contrary to the past " theory of China threat " , many reports in Japan now hold that China 's economic development is helpful to the recovery of Japan 's economy and China 's big growing market demand is an important impetus to Japan 's economic development .
The US " Newsweek " recently said in an article that the rise of China is an opportunity instead of a menace to other countries especially to its neighbors .
The wide-spread " theory of China threat " is being replaced by " theory of China opportunity " .
" Theory of China threat " asserts that the development of China poses a threat to other countries , especially to its neighbors .
However this provocative instigation of assumption has not been accepted by China 's neighbors .
The former Malaysian premier Mahathir once said straight away : " Asian countries need not be afraid of China 's growing military and economic power , for China does not have the tradition of conquering other countries . "
The Indian Defense Ministry also believes in one of its long-term plans that China constitutes no threat to India .
In trade governments and enterprises of different countries regard China as their best choice to expand their markets . Overseas investors of big picture firmly illustrate the " theory of China opportunity " with actions : over 400 of the world 500 top enterprises have invested in China .
China has ranked among the top countries in the world in absorbing foreign investment for several years on end .
GDP is an important macro economic index universally used in the world .
It is extremely important for our country to maintain a GDP growth in the whole process of our modernization drive .
Only because the GDP growth by each percent will bring about job opportunities for 800,000 people in our country , we do have every reason to maintain the fast economic growth rate .
The grand goal of building an all-round well-off society and the strategic aim for the 3rd stage of our modernization depend on the sustained fast GDP growth to a great extent .
However , we should see the deficiencies of GDP .
For instance , it cannot easily reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth accurately , nor the social welfare level actually enjoyed by people , Nor can it accurately measure social distribution and social justice , etc .
On the other hand , GDP is not unique .
In assessing the achievements of an official we should not merely set our eyes on GDP growth , but on the actual material and cultural livelihood of the masses , and also on the unemployment in the locality , social security , social justice , social order , social administration , social harmony , etc .
Therefore , we should approach the GDP accounting system with a scientific spirit , a scientific attitude and scientific ideological methods and give a right place to GDP in the economic and social development .
While we must maintain a considerable growth rate , we must not attach too much importance to it , let alone being one-sided or deliberately going after it .
Since the delegation of the Security Council visited the 6 countries in west Africa at the end of last June , inspiring changes have taken place in the general situation of the whole region although one or two countries have experienced some relapses .
We are glad to notice that the Sierra Leone government has made positive progress in promoting the capability of the army and the police , intensifying the control of the country 's diamond , preparing for the election of local governments , etc . The UN Mission in Sierra Leone is gradually reducing in its size according to the plan .
What also inspries us is that , with the disposition of UN Mission in Liberia , Liberia is getting rid of the influence of the long-time war and is embarking on the road to restoration and reconstruction .
Guinea-Bissau has made headways in its political process and the transitional government has promised to hold legislature election in March this year .
The peace process in Cote d 'Ivoire is taking a turn for the better after some setbacks . All the sides have promised to implement " Linas-Marcoussis Accord " and " the new army " announces to return to the national reconciliation government . The Security Council is considering to send peace-keepers to the country .
We are looking forward to the decision of the Security Council in this regard as soon as possible .
The secretariat , the west African Economic Community and other related sides are working hard to settle the problems of small arms , mercenary troops , children soldiers , etc. and they have made progress .
While acknowledging the above progress completely , we should see that the general situation in the region of west Africa still has its fragile sides . Especially , due to geographical and historical factors , the countries in this region are closely linked and the situation in one country influences another . The turmoil in one country may spread to its neighbors and even to the whole region .
Therefore , as suggested by the Security Council report , when trying to solve the issues in West Africa , the international community including the Security Council should persist in a comprehensive and all-sided strategy , i.e. endeavoring to solve the cross-border issues ; Meanwhile , it should actively help the relevant countries , the African Union , the West African Economic Community and other regional and sub-regional organizations to enhance their capability in preventing and settling conflicts .
We have a consensus that children are the future of the world .
We are obliged to provide them with the best and optimum conditions so as to facilitate their life , study , growth , maturing and success .
However , what is regretful is that in today 's world hundreds of thousands of kids are still suffering from the injury of armed conflicts .
What they are experiencing are turmoil and backwardness. what they are witnessing are violence and destruction . What they are suffering are injuries and abuse . What they feel are sad and helpless .
Therefore , it is the important obligation of the international community to keep children from the injuries of armed conflicts .
All countries , especially those involved in the conflicts , should do their utmost for this purpose .
We are glad to see that in recent years UN has adopted a series of measures in protecting kids from armed conflicts and has made headways .
The Security Council has passed 4 resolutions in succession of 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) and 1460 ( 2003 ) , providing an important frame for the work of children protection .
The peace-keeping activities of UN take the protection of children as their important mission in some regions , including appointment of advisors for children protection and giving full consideration to the special needs of children in the process of helping the countries to demilitarization , demobilization and the plan to return to society .
Some peace accords promoted by UN or with its participation also include clauses on children protection .
National reconciliation is the important condition for peace and stability in the regions after conflicts .
After the conflict is over , the peaceful situation cannot really be consolidated and the conflict flames may even be rekindled if the sides concerned cannot forget their past grudges and give up their past resentments .
Under many circumstances to achieve national reconciliation after a conflict needs joint endeavor from all sides and at the same time requires the international community , especially UN , to provide support and assistance .
For years UN has played a helpful role in promoting the process of national reconciliation in pro-conflict countries and has accumulated much experience . We think that generally speaking UN has to correctly handle 3 major relationships hereinafter in order to successfully help the post-conflict countries to achieve national reconciliation .
It should integrate immediate needs with long-term goals .
National reconciliation normally calls for a considerable process and it can hardly be accomplished in one move .
There should be different priorities at different phases .
The first thing to do in achieving national reconciliation is to make the former fighters to " say good-bye to arms " so as to create an environment of safety .
At this stage it is very important to disarm the former fighters and help them demobilize and return to society .
We are pleased to see that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is getting stable day by day . The ethnic relations are further relaxed . Economic reconstruction is achieving some initial results . Refugees have basically returned home . And its relationship with its neighbors keeps improving .
The progress in the peace process of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been made with great difficulties and it is really gratifying .
We extend our congratulations to the Bosnia-Herzegovina government and people and we wish all the sides in Bosnia Herzegovina to keep on working , to further enhance mutual trust and cooperation and to advance the peace process continuously .
At the same time we also notice that the state-level organizations and their capacity in Bosnia-Herzegovina need improving , especially such fields as judiciary , police , etc. which still face challenges .
We hold that it is right for the high representative to regard this as its work priority in the first half of this year . We support the Bosnia-Herzegovina government in their cooperation with the high representative .
We believe that people in Bosnia-Herzegovina will , backed up by the international community , score new successes in the reconstruction of their own country and embark on the path of independent development as soon as possible so as to realize the goal of integrating into the European community .
The peace and stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of great significance to realizing lasting peace and development in the region .
China has been concerned with the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation and will work together with the international community in doing its share in helping Bosnia-Herzegovina realize lasting peace and economic development .
China appreciates the efforts of the Anti-Terror Committee in furthering the implementation of UN 's 1373 ( 2001 ) resolution by all countries and helping developing countries to enhance their anti-terror capability construction . It supports the Anti-Terror Committee in its coordination and cooperation with relevant international , regional and sub-regional organizations in the struggle against international terrorists .
In the meanwhile we hope that the Anti-Terror Committee will step up their efforts in assisting the struggle against terrorism and try to meet the actual needs of developing countries .
At present the issue of vitalizing the Anti-Terror Committee has aroused the attention of the member countries .
After repeated negotiation the Anti-Terror Committee has submitted a formal report which is distributed as a document of the Security Council .
Over 2 years of practice shows that the Anti-Terror Committee has faults with its existing structure and operating mode , e.g. the overburden of reports by member countries , too many meetings and documents , working efficiency to be improved , insufficient coordination between experts , etc .
Therefore we fully support the necessary reform of the Anti-Terror Committee and the package plan for setting-up of the Executive Council of the Committee . And we wish that these problems could be well solved as soon as possible , especially the problem of report burden on the member countries .
Here , what I would like to emphasize is that vitalization and reform is a continuous process . No matter what reform will be carried out , the Anti-Terror Committee should exercise its policy guidance and leadership over the executive council and any resolution must be made unanimously at the plenary session of the Committee after careful consultation .
In recent years small arms have arrested the close attention of the international community .
This indicates that all the parties concerned are increasingly aware of the harmful accumulation and contraband of small arms on the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in the regions and countries involved .
Fortunately , UN has taken a series of effective actions in order to solve the problem .
In 2001 " Firearms Protocol " as an attachment to " The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime " and the UN " Program of Action " on small arms have been successively concluded .
They provide legal and policy basis for the settlement of small arms problem and demonstrate the determination of the international community in cracking down on illegal trade of small arms .
In the past 3 years the international community has made great progress in promoting the implementation of " Firearm Protocol " and " Program of Action " . Especially the successful convening in 2003 of the first UN biennial conference on small arms has given new impetus to the all-round and earnest implementation of " Program of Action " .
According to No. 58 / 241 resolution passed at this UN General Assembly , a working group will be set up to negotiate over an international document to identify and investigate illegal small arms . This undoubtedly will step up the endeavor of the international community to crack down on illegal trade of small arms .
Likewise , the UN Security Council has paid more and more attention to the small arms issue . It has held many discussions exclusively on the issue and passed relevant statements and resolutions of the chairman .
In addition , the Security Council has stressed the importance of the small arms issue while discussing how to protect civilians , women and children etc. series issues in conflicts .
Developing economy and eradicating poverty are the pre-requisites of sustainable development .
The sustainable development of economy is a material basis for environmental protection and all-round social progress .
There is no development without settling the problem of survival , let alone sustainable development .
To promote economic development and eradicate poverty is a road of necessity for developing countries to keep a sustainable development .
The development of developed countries cannot continue without settling the poverty problem in developing countries .
To make rational use of natural resources and protect the environment is a natural requirement for realizing the sustainable development .
Development cannot continue if resources are wasted and environment is sacrificed .
Natural resources are by no means inexhaustible , but the demands of social development of mankind keep growing incessantly . If the relationship between the two is not properly handled , it will naturally result in the worsening of environment and pose a great threat to human existence and development .
Only by following the circular economic road which based on effectively using resources and protecting the environment can the sustainable development be materialized .
It is the ultimate goal of sustainable development to realize the all-round social progress and promote the level and quality of people 's livelihood .
A year ago the 9th informal meeting of leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization was held at the riverside of Huangpujiang River in Shanghai . The scene of the meeting is still vivid in my mind .
Today we are gathering in the beautiful Los Cabos on the Pacific coast to discuss about the important issues of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation .
I am so happy to meet old friends .
Here I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my heart-felt thanks to President Fox for his invitation and to the Mexican government for its considerate arrangements .
In the past year economic globalization kept progressing and science and technology developed with each passing day , which have brought about new development opportunities for all countries .
In the meanwhile the uncertainties in the global economic development increased . Some countries and regions including members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization faced new challenges in the process of their economic development .
Trade protectionism is again showing up and we still have a long way to go to effect free , fair and just trade .
The anti-terror struggle is arduous and complicated and the non-traditional security factors have increased .
This world of ours is still very unstable .
Although the international community still faces problems of one kind or another and there will be all kinds of unexpected problems ahead , the trend of the day for peace and development cannot be reversed and the wish of the peoples of all countries for a better life has not changed .
This dialogue meeting has the theme of development , which is of great significance .
Development is the basis of the progress of human civilization and the key to the settlement of all kinds of contradictions and problems confronting the whole world .
Only by realizing global harmony , balance and universal development can the world lasting peace and stability be achieved .
We should carry out an all-round and profound discussion of this theme and work as one to settle this problem .
The fast development of the trend of economic globalization is the most distinguished feature of today 's world economy .
Propelled by the economic globalization trend , the link between countries and regions is becoming closer day by day ; markets are more open ; the financial , technological and talent flow is more extensive and faster . All this has brought about an unprecedented opportunity for promoting international cooperation and joint development .
At the same time the development of economic globalization has brought about severe challenges . The south-north gap is widening ; some developing countries face the danger of further peripheralization ; economic and financial risks increase ; transnational crimes become serious . All this makes it more necessary and urgent to have international cooperation to deal with such challenges .
At this moment when opportunities and challenges coexist , we should seize the chance to deal with challenges , seek common ground and leave aside differences , expand cooperation and promote the development of economic globalization towards joint development and prosperity .
( International ) Spread of Influenza Has Reached Its Summit in America
Xinhua News Agency in Los Angeles on Dec . 31st ( Reporter Yan Liang ) The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on 31st that the great influenza whose scale has not been seen for 30 years has reached its highest point . Large spread of the disease is found in 45 of the US 50 states and death cases caused by influenza grow drastically .

At least 42 children have died of influenza in all over the states . Deaths of adults grow quickly , but no accurate statistics is available .
According to experts , there are 2 reasons for the quick spread of influenza in 2003 . First , the influenza virus is not the " Panama A Virus " of the past few years and the vaccines produced earlier cannot effectively prevent it . Second , two major vaccine manufacturers have reduced their production down to 83 million shots this year because of surplus last year . This has resulted in the short supply of vaccines .
Although 36,000 people die of influenza and 114,000 people are hospitalized because of the disease each year on an average , such a influenza spread that has caused social panic is rare .
According to William Thompson , an expert of epidemics , this influenza is the most serious in recent 30 years . It came earlier than the past and large-scale spread occurred in many schools . There are long queues in the place where vaccines are injected against influenza .
Facing such a severe situation , the American Health Ministry launched its emergency treatment center on December 19 and dispatched its expert groups to the states .

Xinhua News Agency in New York on January 6th ( Reporter Xue Yanping ) The Institute for Supply Management , a famous American research institution Institute in USA issued a report on 6th which shows that the index of American service trades fell in December last year .

( International ) The Exchange Rate of USD Has Again Fallen into A New Low
( Xinhua News Agency in New York on January 8th ) Influenced by the speech of the President of European Central Bank , the USD exchange rate has fallen to a new low on 8th after a brief rise on 7th .
European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet delivered a commentary that day , saying that the over high Euro exchange rate would affect the export of European enterprises . But he believes that the gradual recovery of world economy and the growth of consuming demands partly offset the impact of the upward revaluation of Euro .
In the meanwhile he points out that the strong Euro plays a positive role in stabilizing prices in Euro regions to some extent . Therefore , European Central Bank decides to maintain the original exchange rate .
Investors regard the commentary as a signal to show that officials in the Euro regions are not worried about the upward revaluation of Euro . As a result they keep selling USD , leading to an all-round low price parity of USD in relation to major western currencies with the British pound-USD exchange rate reaching a record high in 11 years .

( International ) Economic Experts Predict That US to Be The Biggest Winner of Devaluation of US Dollars
Xinhua News Agency in Davos of Switzerland on January 23rd ( Reporters Li Jie and Ding Xigang ) At the 34th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum being held in Davos in Switzerland , the issue of USD devaluation was discussed on 23rd . Some experts predict that America will be the biggest winner of the continuous low exchange rate of USD .
Most of the economic experts attending the meeting hold that American officials , including its Secretary of the Treasure John Snow , seemingly have already given up the " powerful USD policy " pursued by US for years .
The low exchange rate of USD will provide US with larger room for economic development and more job opportunities , which is extremely obvious in the manufacturing industry .
At the same time the devaluation of USD makes US products more competitive on the domestic and world markets . This is conducive for US to compensate its adverse balance of trade .
Bur experts also believe the weak USD will bring about negative effect on America too .
First of all the American stock market may continue to go down and the value of various investments falls . Foreign investors may withdraw their funds for fear of further USD devaluation . Secondly , imported goods are more and more expensive , resulting in the decline of American people 's livelihood . Thirdly , large-scale devaluation of USD may give rise to turbulence in trade and finance .
But the devaluation of USD brings more serious blows to Europe , Japan and Canada .
The decline of USD exchange rate exercises more pressure on the export of European commodities . This means European economy faces the danger of an all-round decline .
China to Speed Up Its Development of Electronic Products in Application Fields of Automobile And Medical Industries
Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on January 26th ( Reporter Feng Xiaofang ) China will accelerate its development of application electronic products such as automobile electronics , machine tool electronics , communication electronics and medical electronics , etc. so as to expand room for electronic information industry development and to meet the needs of all trades .
Responsible persons from Ministry of Information Industry said that one of the priorities in extending and applying information technology is to transform and upgrade traditional enterprises .
To promote the application of information technology in all trades , to improve the equipment of domestic products and to increase their market share not only are the needs for upgrading traditional enterprises but also bring about a rare opportunity for the development of electronic information industry .
It is reported that while room is expanded for the development of electronic information industry and the needs of all trades are met , the capacity system of public technology service should be set up and R & D companies with strength should be backed . Technical support and guarantee should be provided for application of information technology in priority trades through supporting technical standard and testing environment .
At the same time such business as technical service , management advice , system integration , etc. should be developed and such services as system integration and application service suppliers should be brought up so as to push the development of the new information service trade .
( International ) 2003 : Japan Hit New High in Import And Export Volume
Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on January 26th ( Reporter Le Shaoyan ) According to the statistics released by Ministry of Finance in Japan , Japan 's import and export set a historical record in 2003 . Its trade surplus exceeded 10,000 billion Japanese Yen once again after 3 years .
In export , Japan 's export to US last year was 9.8 % lower but its export to Asia increased by 12.9 % .
This not only compensated for the decrease of Japan 's export to US but also helped Japan 's total export to increase by 4.7 % over the previous year , reaching a record high of 54,558.9 billion Japanese Yen .
As for import , due to the increase of demand for petroleum and natural gas and the rocketing of prices , Japan 's total import in 2003 increased by 5 % over the previous year , also reaching a historical record of 44,320.2 billion Japanese Yen .
Japan 's favorable balance of trade in 2003 was 10,238.7 billion Japanese Yen , a 3.6 % growth over the previous year . It exceeded 10,000 billion Japanese Yen once more after 3 years .
The Number of Private Enterprises in Guangzhou Exceeds for The First Time That of the State-Owned And the State-Holding Enterprises
Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on January 26th ( Reporters Chen Ji and Hu Yanni ) News from Guangdong Provincial Industry & Commerce Administration goes that the private enterprises in Guangdong Province outnumber the state-owned and state-holding enterprises for the first time . Domestic-funded enterprises have been effectively restructured .
According to statistics , by the end of 2003 there were altogether 690,000 enterprises of different types ( including domestic-funded , private and foreign-funded ) , a 0.59 % growth over the previous year .
Of these , 316,000 are domestic funded ( a 16.4 % drop over the previous year ) with a registered capital of 1,190.27 billion RMB , a 0.9 % rise ; 323,000 are private enterprises , with a registered capital of 452.28 billion , a 24.9 % and 33.8 % rise respectively ; 52,000 are foreign-funded , with a registered capital of 140.5 billion USD , a 3.6 % and 4.1 % rise respectively .
The actual number of the private enterprises exceeds for the first time that of the state-owned and state-holding enterprises .
Although the state-owned and state-holding enterprises are reduced in number due to restructuring , they are more powerful with an average registered capital of 3.76 million yuan for each , 20 % more than that by the end of 2002 .
According to statistics , the newly-registered enterprises in the whole province total 105,000 with " one type down and two types up " .
Of which , 17,000 are domestic funded enterprises which have declined by 17.6 % over the previous year ; 81,600 are private enterprises which have grown by 29 % over the previous year ; 6,561 are foreign-funded enterprises which have increased by 0.08 % over the previous year .
The proportions between domestic-funded , private and foreign-funded enterprises are 16 : 78 : 6 .
( International ) The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) Submitted The Dispute over " Byrd Subsidy " to Arbitration
Xinhua News Agency in Geneva on January 26th ( Reporter Li Jie ) The WTO announced on 26th that the complaint by EU and other 7 WTO members for sanction against American " Byrd Subsidy " has been submitted to the arbitration authorities .
This complaint for sanction originates from the fact that US has failed to cancel " Byrd Amendment " before the deadline set by WTO .
The Byrd Amendment passed by US Congress in 2000 demands the US government to use the punitive tax from anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases to compensate those US companies whose interests are damaged instead of submitting it to the US Department of Finance .
This practice of US was opposed by its major trade partners like EU , Japan , etc .
The WTO made its final decision in January 2003 that this amendment violates the world trade rules and demanded the US to cancel it before December 27th .
But US has not implemented the decision of the WTO .
For this EU , Japan , Canada , Brazil , India , South Korea , Mexico and Chile applied to WTO recently to have the right to levy added tariffs similar in amount to American government subsidy on some of the products from US .
But later US questions the extent of sanction and the legality of the complaint .
( Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan ) Hong Kong : Retail Business Increased by 10 % in the New Spring
( Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on January 28th ) Hong Kong Retail Administrative Association revealed that during the first days of the lunar new year the retail business in Hong Kong was ideal . The average turnover increased by 10 % with some shopping malls even increasing by 20 % to 30 % .
Chairman Yu Pang Chun of Hong Kong Retail Administrative Association recently said individual tourists from the mainland have stimulated the consumption of Hong Kong . The retail business was ideal during the new spring . Some trades such as jewelry , clothing , etc. have increased by 20 % to 30 % . The consumption of mainland travelers accounts for about 10 % of the total .
He said travelers from the mainland used RMB cards , obviously stimulated the market during the Spring Festival . The average consumption is 3,000 yuan per traveler and some spent as much as 10,000 yuan per tourist .
Last year Hong Kong retail business declined by 4 % due to the impact of SARS .
Yu Pang Chun predicts a single digit growth of Hong Kong retail business this year with the recovery of its economy , but the prices of commodities will be under pressure to rise because of the increase of cost .
He believes the deflation will be improved in Hong Kong .
( International ) Denmark Promulgates New Act to Restrict Immigrants
( Xinhua News Agency in Stockholm on January 28th ) News from Copenhagen says that Danish government has submitted to the congress a new act to restrict immigrants .
According to the act , those Danish-born children from the family of foreign immigrants will no longer enjoy the right of acquiring Danish nationality automatically .
The proposed act is the latest of many measures adopted by Denmark to restrict immigrants since Rasmussen , Leader of Danish Liberal Party , began to work as prime minister in November 2001 .
It is reported that the act is very likely to be passed by the congress , for the Liberal Party has the support of the right-wing Danish People 's Party on the issue of immigration .
The law requires that the Danish-born children of foreigners , when grown up , to apply for nationality like other immigrants , instead of acquiring nationality automatically .
Those immigrants who have already acquired nationality will be deprived of it if they commit crimes that pose great menace to the society .
In the past 2 years Danish government has promulgated a series of restriction policies , including limitation of issuing long-term residence permits and restriction of immigrant 's bringing their family members to Denmark .
The unfriendly attitude of Danish government towards immigrants has reduced the number of refugees from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
The image of Denmark as a liberal and human right country is therefore spoiled .
We should not take for granted the achievements made by Singapore .
No matter how developed science and technology are , I don 't think that people , without working hard , keeping social order and adapting to changes , can maintain an ideal environment in which life is of high level and quality , everyone has a job and wages keep rising .
Such wonderful things cannot come about of their own accord .
Only when all the people understand that they must put the public interest in the first place and give hard reconciliation and adaptation can everyone have a bright future .
What will Singapore be like in 10 or 20 years ?
We all wish to be able to predict , but the future is hardly predictable .
Many factors are beyond the Singapore control .
The development of many things is dependent on the development of the world situation .
We have no idea when problems will occur . On many occasions it depends on luck .
For instance , 3 Singapore tourists went to Hong Kong and were infected by SARS . Such things couldn 't be predicted .
For less than a month after the spring festival , there have been 3 extraordinarily large safety accidents , each of which resulted in more than 10 deaths .
The high frequency and the heavy casualties are lamenting .
Several months before this , the blowout of natural gas oil pipes in Chongqing , gas explosions on several coal mines and frequently occurred traffic accidents had caused several hundred deaths .
China is vast and densely populated and the disaster probability is greater than in other countries . A disaster often results in dozens or even hundreds of deaths . This is an objective and helpless fact .
But common sense tells us that the death accidents in China are still too frequent .
Of various disasters , fires , coal mine explosions , explosions of fireworks factories and passenger transport accidents are the greatest in number .
This gives expression to 2 facts at least . First , safety measures in these aspects are the weakest . Second , people have not drawn lessons from these tragedies . As a result these accidents keep repeating themselves .
In the past when Singapore was experiencing high economic growth rates , there also occurred serious fires , which still remain to be tragic memories and have swiftly enhanced Singapore 's precaution consciousness of security in the public places .
China is likewise at an unusual stage of fast economic growth and big social transition .
It is occasionally heard that foreign housemaids working in the locality accidentally fall off buildings . Although the number of such accidents is not abnormally high , such fall-off-building accidents run much counter to the nature of household work in which casualty should be low , considering the relatively safe environment of house-maid work .
Data show that from January 1999 to June 2003 altogether 99 housemaids from different countries died from falling off buildings .
Behind the figure are broken families who are waiting for daughters or mothers to return home . Behind it are tragedies that may well have been avoided and is the orientation of our endeavor to do our best to reduce the regretful figure to the minimum .
According to the announcement recently released by the Indonesian Embassy , 96 Indonesian housemaids have died when they worked in Singapore since 1999 and some of them died from falling off the building while working in high buildings .
Facing that the Indonesian government has now and then expressed their resentment over such accidents , we have also worked out new regulations many times to exercise stricter control of the quality of Indonesian housemaid in the place so as to ensure their safety . However , the problem remains unsettled . The relationship between Singapore and Indonesia in inevitably perplexed by the housemaid issue .
What profoundly confuses people is the fact that , compared with the casualties of foreign laborers on construction sites , the casualties of housemaids ' falling off the building are higher . This gives food for thought and it is necessary to study the background and causes of such accidents .
Mr. Chen Kongli , a worldly famous expert on Taiwan issues in Mainland China , recently published his new book " Observing Taiwan " .
Most of the essays included in the book were written after March 2000 when the substitution of political parties took place in Taiwan for the first time . They reflect the author 's observation and reflections , up to the time when Chen Shui-bian put forward his " one country on either side " theory , on internal situation in Taiwan and the cross-strait relationship during the period of the author 's " not only listening to what he says but also watching what be does . "
The articles written 2 years ago cannot be published until now . This shows that the screening procedure on the mainland is complicated and long for the articles related to Taiwan studies . It shows more clearly that it is not easy for " Observing Taiwan " to be accessible to readers .
For a long time Mr. Chen Kongli has always been realistic and factual in observing and studying issues related to Taiwan . He has never let himself be confined by subjectively preset political frames and has endeavored to explore and find unique viewpoints .
After reading the book it is even more profoundly impressed by this characteristic of the book .
After early 80s of the last century Taiwan studies became " a popular subject " and many research institutions appeared . All kinds of scholars and experts show up prominently .
Overseas people normally divide the mainland research institutions of Taiwan studies into Northern School and Southern School .
The Northern School , whose stand is near to the official position , is unyielding in remarks . It displays the aggressive color of the hawk in some specific historical periods or on some important of developments political conjuncture .
And the Southern School of Taiwan study institutions are mostly scattered south of the Yangtze River including Shanghai , Fujian and other places .
The Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is accused by the Japanese media as overstatement on his " educational background " of " studying in London for 2 years " .
The Japanese " Post Newsweek " proves to the Dean 's Office of London University that during his 9 month stay in Britain Junichiro Koizumi only attended several courses as a visitor and did not get any academic degree .
This scandal is covered or reprinted by Chinese media , large or small , to the immense gratification of the compatriots .
Indeed , the prime minister of such a country goes so far as to fabricate his educational background and cheat his own people .
It is an even greater disgrace especially when it happened in the " imperialist " Japan .
However , if we approach it from a different angle , perhaps we may see some positive meaning out of this scandal .
And this something positive is something we are lacking in and is what we need to improve .
In recent years we have been advocating " honesty " and have been trying to " construct a sunshine government " , respect the public 's " right to know " and promote the " transparency " of administration . But there is still a far cry between fact and ideal .
Please think , the " adulterate " diploma of a prime minister is not something of magnitude . However , it is exposed by mass media which refuse to give up half way .
In such a country , is there anything else that can not be " sunshine " ?
In evening gatherings of the election campaign , different camps would use sight-seeing buses to take the masses to the meeting place . But the recent situation is such that the evening gathering in favor of Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu is obviously less busy than that in favor of Lien and Soong .
Not long ago the Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian was shouting " we will be elected " at a campaign meeting in northern Taiwan , when half of the participants refused to echo him . It turned out that most of the people in the place have relatives who have invested on the mainland and they felt uneasy when the " three direct links " across the Taiwan straits had been delayed again and again and Chen 's financial policy had yielded little results .
Except for surprises , when Taiwan election comes to the count down , we can suppose that Chen and Lu will fail , judging from the signs of public opinion polls and illegal betting .
Except for sensational unexpectations such as major split or more ugly scandal of pan-blue , Chen Shui-bian who succeeded Lee Teng-hui after arduous struggle has proved that he could not effectively win over the support of the people in the past 4 year . Instead , black gold , the low-taste role and performance of pan-green have weakened the confidence of their supporters .
How will Beijing treat the pan-blue forces which may assume power again ?
The first thing we should understand is that the pan-blue army which may assume power again is no longer the pure monolithic Kuomintang , but a combination of blue and orange and whether or not the inner tradition has merged with the nativist .
The close cooperation in the election period should be not considered as the inevitable future relationship .
If it is likely to be elected , it will surely need considerable time to conduct internal regrouping . The legislature election which comes immediately afterwards at the end of the year will make it difficult for the Lien -Soong Administration to make major changes on the cross-strait relations .
Unless it is aware that the improvement of the cross-strait relations will add to its political points and it is sure to accomplish results in a short period of time . The most important thing is to enable the public to feel the results .
With this background in view , Beijing should slow down its action of pushing for reunification so as to leave enough time for the Lien-Soong " traditional blue camp " to consolidate their control of the internal affairs .
More than half a century has passed since July 1945 when US carried out its first nuclear explosion in New Mexico and August of the same year when it dropped 2 A-bombs on Japan .
Although the 2 superpowers of the USA and the Soviet Union had piled up in their arms race the nuclear weapons enough to destroy the whole world , both came to realize the danger of a nuclear war and avoided pushing down on the nuclear button .
After the Soviet Union disintegrated , the world entered into a post-cold war era and the danger of a large nuclear war was eliminated .
But at the same time nuclear proliferation has increased instead of being decreased .
Such proliferation embodies itself in 2 aspects .
First , some countries above the intermediate level in resources and strength have tried every means to produce and possess nuclear weapon to achieve their diplomatic ends of contending with their neighbors , maintaining peace and blackmail strategy .
Secondly , some non-state mass organizations , especially those Moslem extremist forces hostile to the west , are also trying by hook or by crook to lay hands on small nuclear weapons in order to carry out bloody terrorist attacks against the west at the sacrifice of large numbers of innocent people .
Such needs have given rise to brokers dealing in nuclear weapons , and the transfer of related technology and to " the nuclear black market " . Their number is increasing daily and it has become an important part of the world nuclear proliferation today .
As a descend of the Yellow Emperor who grew up in the area around the Lake area , HangJia , I still remember the rural scene and the peasants ' life south of the Yangtze River .
On returning to the hometown after years of separation I find that the green farmland along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is dotted with brand-new 3-storeyed buildings built by the farmers themselves and there are few peasants working in the fields .
This is really surprising me and I can hardly believe that such great changes have taken place on my motherland of which I have always cherished of fond memory in foreign country .
But recently I read on the internet some reportage and investigation reports by scholars on the rural situation which took me by surprise and shocked me .
Out of my expectation there is such a dark side of rural China and Chinese peasants are leading such a humiliating , no rights and miserable life .
The long reportage entitled " Investigation into China 's Countryside " written by Chen Guidi and his wife after their inquiry in the 3 provinces of Anhui , Henan and Hebei pleads on behalf of the people and has caused sensation in China 's society .
They draw such a conclusion from lots of facts about peasants suffering from oppression of corrupt officials and innocent people being killed : " Approaching China 's countryside we feel unprecedented shock and pain . We have seen unexpected poverty , startling crimes , surprising helplessness , astonishing opposing , unforeseen silence and sorrow . "
This has put me into extreme grief .
As expected the Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah announced the day before yesterday to dissolve the parliament and the new election will be held soon .
For Abdullah the on-coming election is an event of great importance . For the political situation and its trend for development , it is also of symbolic significance .
Abdullah took over power from Mahathir last November . 4 months have passed since then .
In spite of this he has decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election in advance .
This contains 2 meanings at least . First , Abdullah feels satisfied with his 4 months of administration and is fully confident about the voting of electors . Secondly , he wishes to consolidate his power through this and to get rid of the shadow of Mahathir .
Undoubtedly , Abdullah 's abrupt decision to hold the election shows that he has had an overall judgement of the domestic political situation .
The economic situation in Malaysia is good now and there is nothing for the opposition party to publicize maliciously or to make use of .
Besides , since Abdullah took over power , he has taken some visible measures to fight corruption including the arrest and prosecution of the former Land and Cooperative Development Minister Kasitah Gaddam . These measures have won general approval and the public is now optimistic and is looking forward to the future anti-corruption acts .
In the meanwhile he calls for better efficiency in civil service , which helps to promote people 's trust .
Since its inception , the European Union has been influenced by French politics and culture in its growth and maturity .
It seeks independence and self-reliance in diplomacy and differs from US in its approach and handling of international affairs . From this trend of the EU diplomatic policies , we can clearly see the shadow of France .
It is because of this that the international community including China , Russia and Arab countries wish to see the rise of EU and wish to find an entirely independent force in international intercourse .
We have to admit that since 1980s EU has been really moving towards this orientation in diplomacy .
In December 1992 the EU countries reached an agreement on the Mastricht Summit that all member countries shall carry out unified diplomatic policies and speak to the outside world with one voice .
But 2 years later in handling the Bosnia issue , the so-called " unified diplomatic policies " met with total failure .
From Mastricht Summit to the present , the 10-year EU diplomacy has yielded few results .
What 's more , the EU diplomatic policies cannot stand the test of great events .
The different attitudes adopted by the member countries towards Iraqi War not only bear out this point but also once again fully unveil the fatal political deficiencies of EU , i.e. it is easily divided and controlled by other powers .
On February 24 President Bush announced in the White House that he will support the constitutional amendment on prohibition of homosexual marriage .
This is a noticeable change of his ambiguous attitude on this issue for months and it represents a major political development in America 's year of election .
The constitutional amendment on banning homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern America which is the new headquarters of the Republican . But it also has its negative effect , i.e. this cultural dispute of great magnitude which splits public opinion will undoubtedly speed up the polarization of American politics all over the country and will further alienate the east and the west coasts dominated by liberalists .
For Bush himself who repeatedly announced during the election in 2000 that he was " a uniter " , not " a splitter " , this is obviously an indication that his deeds run counter to his words .
Besides , the young Americans are more and more liberal on the homosexual issues . This act by Bush will harm the long-term interest of the Republican though it may yield short-term effects .
The new offensive " Amendments to the Constitution " by Bush may be called " the scorched earth strategy " for the presidential election this year .
Bush adopts this strategy because , after his position is being weaken on the 2 major issues of " anti-terror " war and economy-employment , he had to open up a new battle field on the religious and cultural themes splitting the domestic public opinion .
The US 's attitude has remained cautions till now .
In other words , because maintaining the status quo on Taiwan Strait can meet the American long-term goal of checking the mainland in strategy , US has to avoid political and military conflicts with China resulting from encouraging Taiwan independence .
One can imagine that US cannot possibly deprive Taiwan of all its space for a referendum in complete conformity with Beijing 's demand . But it will adopt some warning acts in view of its own interest .
Recently the American State Secretary Powell reiterated the US policy towards Taiwan and initially expressed the US stand against Taiwan independence .
This declaration of attitude is interpreted by the outsiders as a check and prevention of Chen Shui-bian from being possessed by the Devil .
Some American think-tankers with official background have made statements and US will send lots of spy ships to the Taiwan Strait in surveillance of the military movements on both two coasts . All this indicated indirectly that US is very much concerned about the situation in Taiwan Strait .
Watching from another angle , one may find that , although US will not completely prevent Taiwan from holding a referendum according to the demand of Beijing , it feels very much worried about the uncertainties in the situation of Taiwan Strait .
For any large and one-to-one election , only one result will come about , either Chen Shui-bian will be lucky to keep his presidency or Lien Chan will preside over the Taiwan presidential palace over again .
The anxiety is that , when information and communication are not well matched , people from all circles on the mainland are not psychologically prepared for the possible victory on the part of Chen Shui-bian .
If the election result is contrary to its wish , Beijing will be once again put into an unnecessary and passive predicament .
An ancient Arabic proverb goes : " One day 's turmoil is worse than a thousand years ' tyranny . "
Is this what the northeast Asian countries are worried about presently ?
I think the answer is probably affirmative .
A well-known research and development center which is near Washington and is sponsored by the US government studies the 4 optional decisions on dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis in one of its latest investigations , i.e. engagement , blocking , economic sanction and pre-emptive .
The attitudes of the countries in the region towards the strategy have been the focus of this investigation .
Besides , the investigation provides an analysis of the threat posed by the North Korean nuclear program , based on the possible nuclear attack and its damage assumed by the neighbors of North Korea and on their fears .
China and Russia hold that the danger of North Korea using nuclear weapons is low or very low while Japan and South Korea believe that the threat is considerably great .
All the northeast Asian countries are in favor of engagement with North Korea .
Japan is for blocking and other countries believe that blocking strategy is acceptable in some circumstance .
Singapore attaches great importance to international ranking and pays attention all the year round to various rankings of countries released by European and American agencies .
Often ranking among the top countries naturally adds to our interest in this regard .
But if you are ranked first in everything , troubles and vexations may come about .
Generally speaking , our people think that if you care too much about the ranking , it seems you are afraid of losing . If you give prominence to your ranking , you seem to be arrogant .
So people say we should be free and easy . The best thing is to stand aloof from worldly success .
As many people scorned the rankings , there appeared an odd phenomenon : people no longer regard " the world first " as a good tiding , but rather something embarrassing .
However , in the past one or two years , things began to change again .
We feel doubtful about our country 's long-term competitive power . People of all trades are worried about their jobs .
With these doubts , we can no longer be free and easy when we speak .
International competition is fierce . Being too free and easy may lead to the result that others may catch up . Being first in everything may become backward in everything .
On the surface Bush is very loyal to Cheney . At the meeting of Republican state governors held at the end of last month , Bush swore his loyalty by saying that Cheney is the only candidate for vice president .
But he said half jokingly that as in 2000 he has entrusted Cheney to find a vice president candidate for him .
Cheney who has always concealed his true intentions and has held himself in low profile shows up frequently in recent days at press interviews , denying that he would be replaced .
But he leaves himself an out .
He said that he would withdraw if there is something wrong with his health or if he becomes a burden on the president .
Cheney is 63 years old and has a record of 4 heart attacks .
Recently word has it that the US army has actually surrounded the culprit of September 11th attack Osama and waits for the right opportunity to catch him alive .
Ballots will be cast on November 2 for presidential election . It is said that the Pentagon has made arrangements for Osama to be captured in October , making it a good show .
But there is many a slip between the cup and the lip . If Osama should escape , there will be no end of troubles .
So it appears that Giuliani is a relatively safe trump card in winning votes .
The opponents for the American 2004 presidential election have been determined : the Democratic candidate Kerry challenges the Republic President Bush .
Before the general election in November they will unfold " warming up activities " such as advertising publicity , election debates. etc .
They will perhaps be engaged in oral and literal battles around 3 tops of war , economy and society .
Bush holds that the war is closely associated with the state security of US . To send troops to topple Saddam and fight terror both aim to ensure the safety of US . So he has said again and again to the American public : " We are now at war . "
Kerry of course will point out Bush 's mistake of abusing the wrong information about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and sending troops there .
In economy Kerry advocates that Bush 's plan to reduce tax will only benefit the rich and cannot create more job opportunities .
Bush shows to Kerry : Are the statistics of American economy on the rise ?
On social issues , e.g. relationship between male and female , Bush is against homosexual marriage and abortion and is in favor of capital punishment , while Kerry is also against homosexual marriage but is for abortion and against capital punishment .
For Bush and Kerry , how to present their viewpoints on the 3 major issues through advertisements , TV and speeches and how to persuade the voters will be their political shows in the next 8 months .
Nevertheless , Kerry has relatively more room to show off on diplomatic issues .
Statistics show that young people who commit suicide are mostly between 15 and 19 years old , and some are the younger between 10 to 14 old .
It is generally believed that pressure of academic study is the leading cause for children and adolescents to kill themselves . However , investigations show that affection , especially love between boys and girls , and the relationship between adolescents and their parents are even more important in leading them to end up their lives .
Pressure from lessons and disappointment from expectation of course belong to the category of communication between children and their parents .
Pressure resulting from going to schools of higher grade is an inevitable burden on children in their development . Sometimes the pressure comes from the adolescents themselves and mostly it is imposed on them by their parents .
Parents demand higher academic records and often compare their children with other kids . They demand their children to do even better , which causes great pressure . But persuasion and communication behind the pressure are the thermometer that measures the relationship between kids and parents .
If the parents beat and abuse their children , or blame them by giving a black look simply because they don 't live up to their expectation , or if they make children feel they are disappointing , this undoubtedly drives the kids to a helpless situation .
It is said that many adolescents who need psychiatric help are perplexed simply because the extraordinarily high expectation of their parents has put them into an inescapable corner .
The success and fast development of Singapore make parents feel that their children have far better material conditions and inevitably they think that their kids should excel them in performance .
Normally , parents forget the fact that they might not be very excellent in everything when they were kids .
Once one and a half years old , most of the kids are sent to boarding nurseries of departments and institutions and the authorities charge a little token money . Kids come back home only once a week or even once a month .
Today Singapore faces the social issue of dropping birth rates and aging of population .
The younger generation are busy maintaining modern living standards and modern material enjoyments . They cannot afford to respond to the government call for early marriage and early birth .
The author has a bold proposal to make , i.e. the government accepts newly-born babies .
The citizens are only encouraged to give birth to babies . They don 't have to worry about the fostering of children .
On the one hand the government provides boarding nurseries , boarding kindergartens and even boarding primary schools and supplies 3-meal-a-day service . It charges the citizens a little token money which they can easily afford .
This not only provides job opportunities for the unemployed but also frees the government from worrying whether or not such measures as baby awards , prolonging the maternity leave , promoting quality of housemaid , tax kickback , etc. will achieve the desired results .
What Beijing needs to do is not just acting as the chief guide of the 6-party talk but to set its eye on China 's long-term interest on the Korean Peninsula . It should take precautions and start its strategic deployments as soon as possible .
To be specific , Beijing should on the one hand urge North Korea to give up its nuclear arms and one the other hand , guide North Korea onto the track of modern civilization through the transformation of Kim Jong-il regime , remove the danger of a nuclear warm from northeast Asia and keep the status quo on the Korean Peninsula so as to obtain bargaining counters in its strategic dealing with the USA .
Pyongyang , fierce of mien but faint of heart , is eager in its heart to develop its economy and merge into the international community .
But this strong desire displays itself in the outer form of valiance , irrationality and sometimes not in conformity with international regulations .
In fact , Beijing has , for a period of time , used its influence and the means of economic aid to compel Pyongyang to change its position running counter international rules .
But this act still needs overall planning .
The aid of Beijing to Pyongyang should not be confined to the economic level and should be extended to other social fields . It should not be limited to forcing Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program . It should focus on guiding the regime onto the road to modern civilization .
In the early days when Kerry entered the arena , nobody cherished much hope on him . At that time all the focus was on the former Vermont governor Dean .
But in January before the Party meeting was held in Iowa , Kerry , a dark horse , appeared and won the Party meeting and primary elections in the 2 most essential states of Iowa and New Hampshire .
In the following states primary elections Kerry , on the whole , did not lose except for those states which had their own candidates
Only in 6 week 's time Kerry became the final candidate from a candidate with little prospects . All his competitive opponents were defeated one after another including Gephardt , Lieberman , Clark , Dean and Edwards . People cannot but look at Kerry 's political charm with new eyes .
In his 19 years of career as a congressman Kerry has always supported abortion and policies of environmental protection and opposed the tax reduction plan benefiting the rich . He has devoted himself to promoting the minimum wages and wishes to solve the problem of global warming .
His working experience in Washington demonstrates his courage that he likes to meet the difficult social issues head on and is brave to challenge authorities . He seeks value and is never afraid of offending the minority .
China 's reform and opening-up policy started from agriculture and rural residents were the first beneficiaries of the policy .
But after 1990s the substantial bias of the economic policies to big cities resulted in the basic standstill of the agrarian reform . The gap between the rural and urban regions was increasingly widened as a result .
As time went on , in China appear two entirely different worlds : one is the highly prosperous cities and the other is the poor and backward countryside .
To quote Chinese officials , the widening gap between the rich cities and the poor countryside is " a problem in the course of development " and it can be solved by sustaining the development .
In other words China 's coastal regions and cities should keep developing and should not be held back by the rural problems .
However , on seeing small changes in one year and big changes in 3 years in large cities , people cannot help asking why few changes have taken place for decades in some poverty-stricken areas .
Of course we have to admit the fact that the rural areas and cities differ in their developing ways , but the problem is , while investing large sums of money in urban construction and in encouraging and backing the rich middle class , whether or not the rural people occupying 70 % of the whole population have enjoyed the same care and attention .
In theory it cannot claim that all the previous Chinese governments have failed to attach importance to agriculture , rural areas and peasants .
But in the past years things have been more and more difficult and have become worse in the countryside . This shows that the attention paid to the countryside is becoming more and more insufficient .
In any country public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts are symbols of justice and fairness and are the most important system in safeguarding social stability .
But unfortunately public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts are symbols of corruption in China .
According to a report released recently by the National Audit Office which last year has carried out auditing of the financial expenditures of public security departments in 26 provinces and cities , the irregular amount of money had come up to 16.5 billion RMB .
The trust crisis in public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts has been known to all .
The Liu Yong event , Sun Zhigang event and the recent " BMW " incident in Heilongjiang reflect this profound distrust .
The " BMW " incident is an example in point .
People give much more attention and concern to this issue than to the SARS in the period of its spreading .
In fact what people 's attention focus on is no longer the " BMW " incident itself , but expresses the distrust on the whole law-enforcing system .
Departments concerned are very clear about this , so before long they took suffocating measures against mass media .
Nevertheless , problems remain there .
The second round of 6-party talks on the Korean Peninsula issue has come to a conclusion as people generally expected .
During the talks the parties concerned have had contacts and explorations on the exterior issues around the peninsula nuclear crisis and have reached a consensus on holding the 3rd round of talks before the end of June and on setting up a working group .
But on such substantial issues as how North Korea should give up its nuclear weapon development program , how US should guarantee the North Korea 's political and military safety after it gives up the nuclear plan and the energy supply to North Korea , etc . , not only no progress has been made but also people are made to feel as if " the fast knot " is getting increasingly tight .
The two leading roles  North Korea and US have demonstrated no concessions and their bottom lines remain unyielding .
However , the fascinating thing is that US showed during the talks an attitude of not being eager to settle the problem . It gives people the impression of " procrastination " .
The tactics demonstrated by US is closely associated with the present developments of the international situation and the interest it is seeking in the new developments .
Never have so many bosses been imprisoned in US since Roosevelt became the president .
Is it a coincidence , or have the public and investors been driven beyond forbearance in the past 3 years to the corporate crimes and other illegal acts of corporations , which resulted in the exposure of so many crimes in such a short period recently ?
The answer may not be simple , but it is a fact that the crimes of so many companies have been laid bare .
This is a good sign for economic recovery and the restoration of investors ' confidence .
Late 1990s may be one of the most disorderly and most unfathomable periods in the history of American commerce . The sooner its influence disappears , the better .
When everything settles down , the names of some companies will fade out in history . And in the end , only in the textbooks of business schools ' can they be found .
Some other companies such as Tyco and MCI will regroup themselves under the leadership of new teams and try to greet the coming of a new round of economic growth .
When will the new round of economic growth come about ?
You , as a CEO , may have no answer .
It does not matter , because the Chairman of US Federal Reserve Greenspan does not know the answer either .
The Bush Administration intends to stimulate economy with Keynesianism , increasing expenditure ( especially expenditure for national defense ) on the one hand and reducing tax on the other hand .
In international affairs the Bush Administration continues its free trade policy , but the trade deficit has amounted to 549 billion USD , a new high in record .
After tax has been greatly reduced , investment and consumption do not show obvious sign of growth .
The new Keynesian school represented by the celebrated British economist Wyme Godley holds that the US economy has been caught in a difficult situation and Bush 's financial and economic strategy can not turn the tide .
They think the so-called " market rule assuming command " is but an illusion and will naturally lead to benefiting the minority and harming the majority .
People used to believe that in the entire world the so-called benefited minority are all in the USA and the harmed majority are all in developing countries .
But now it is no longer so .
Many people in American economic circles hold that today winners of globalization obviously include India and China , in addition to the US-based multi-national corporations .
India occupies the domain of service economy and China takes up the manufacture realm .
People concentrate their attention on the phenomenon that large amount of the US funds and equipments are flowing to China . But they do not see the advantage of China 's high level and low income labor market .
First of all , whether the Taiwan situation is within or beyond the estimation of Beijing .
Nobody but Beijing itself knows how it estimates the situation . But the result of the estimation can be inferred from some public phenomena .
For 4 years Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of the independent camp have been clear-cut in rhetoric , smart and diligent in action and progressive and aggressive in independent endeavor .
On the contrary Beijing , except for occasional high-pitched rhetoric , is close to routine in its attitude and seems indifferent to the progress of Taiwan independence .
But since the fall last year , it has become entirely different , as if an ox-cart changes into a car . Since several months ago , It has been obvious that its handling capacity is completely different from that in 1990s .
Judging from this , the Taiwan situation is within its estimation .
Secondly , we must look at its diplomacy related to Taiwan .
As for the development of Taiwan Strait situation , we must find out whether the attitude of important countries like the USA is near to that of Beijing , or to that of Taiwan .
As the attitudes of countries are open , the answer is clear .
Up till now those countries become closer to Beijing and have more contact with it while they get further away from Taiwan and had relatively little contact with it . And they begin to give " light words and earnest wishes " advice to Taiwan democracy which has been acclaimed .
