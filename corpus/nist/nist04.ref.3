European Mars Probe Beagle 2 Remains Silent after Landing
( AFP , London , January 1 ) Barratt , the spokesman for the Mars Exploration Project , said that after a U.S. satellite failed to establish contact with the European Mars lander Beagle 2 that has landed on Mars , hopes of retrieving signals from Beagle 2 can now only be placed on its mothership Mars Express .
Barratt said : " We did not get any result again . "
He said : " We have now placed our hope on its mothership Mars Express and are waiting for it to pick up some signals . "
Yesterday the U.S. spacecraft Mars Odyssey failed to pick up any signal from the European Mars probe Beagle 2 , which has been continuing its search for signs of life on Mars after it detached itself from Mars Express and landed on the planet .
Spacecraft Mars Odyssey was launched by NASA to orbit Mars on a separate mission of exploration .
The European Space Agency headquartered in Paris said the European-made satellite Mars Express has been launched to the polar orbit of Mars and hopefully it can still send back some signals next week .
Beagle 2 was originally scheduled to land on Mars on Christmas Day , but its signals have remained elusive .
After Beagle 2 detached itself from its mothership Mars Express on December 19 , it became the first European spacecraft to land on another planet .
It was planned that during its 18-day mission , Beagle 2 would test rock , soil , signal transmission mode or all the present life forms , etc. collected from Mars .
Scientists once boldly predicted this British spacecraft might get stuck in a crater .

China Confiscates 186 Tons of U.S. Beef
( AFP , Beijing , January 2 ) China 's state media Beijing Youth Daily reported today that due to the market concern that imported beef may be contaminated by the virus of mad cow disease , the relevant authorities started inspections of meat markets and confiscated 186 tons of U.S. beef in Beijing yesterday .
Beijing Youth Daily pointed out that on the advice of the Ministry of Agriculture , the beef will be destroyed after the inspection .
Over thirty countries in the world suspended the import of U.S. beef last week , and China is one of them .
Except milk , other dairy products , leather and gelatin used in photography , all cow-related products are banned .
Beijing Youth Daily reported that Beijing Bureau of Agriculture recently issued a series of preventative and monitoring ordinances and conducted a full-scale inspection of markets .
So far , no case of mad cow disease has been reported in any part of China .
This was the second confiscation of beef in the recent week . Prior to that , on a U.S. freighter in Ningbo , Zhejiang Province , the relevant authorities seized 60 kilos of beef from Washington State of the United States where the mad cow disease was reported .
Although statistics from the Ministry of Commerce show that China imported a total amount of 532 million U.S. dollars worth of meat products from the United States , the amount of imported U.S. beef remains unclear .
From January to July last year , China imported a total amount of 316 million U.S. dollars worth of meat products from the United States .
North Korea Said to Have Authorized U.S. Delegation Visit to Yongbyon Nuclear Facilities
( AFP , Washington , January 2 ) USA Today reported today that Pyongyang has authorized a U.S. delegation whose members include a top nuclear scientist to visit North Korea 's Yongbyon facilities next week .
Members of the delegation told USA Today that the Bush administration has approved the delegation 's visit to North Korea scheduled from January 6 to January 10 .
This will be the first time a foreign delegation pays a visit to the controversial North Korean nuclear facilities since the UN inspectors were expelled by North Korea about a year ago .
The U.S. delegation includes a China expert from Stanford University , two Senate foreign policy aides and a former State Department official in charge of dealing with Pyongyang authorities .
The delegation 's nuclear expert is Hecker , who , from 1985 to 1997 , headed the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory where the first nuclear bomb was developed .
Prior to this , North Korea recently informed the U.S. embassy in Beijing that Pyongyang authorities plan to attend the postponed second round of six-nation talks on the nuclear crisis in the Korean Peninsula .
U.S. officials pointed out early this week that Pyongyang authorities have already indicated that they will attend the six-nation talks to be held early this year .
No result was achieved at the first round of six-nation talks that took place in Beijing in August last year . North Korea later attacked the negotiation as " totally useless . "
The second round of six-nation talks was originally scheduled to take place in December last year , but the disagreement on what measures to take to resolve the issue forced the talks to be postponed till early this year .
Washington demands that North Korea unilaterally abandon its nuclear program , whereas Pyongyang insists that the United States provide a legally binding security guarantee as an exchange for abandoning its nuclear program .
U.S. Government Claims Having No Ties with the U.S. Delegations Visiting North Korea
( AFP , Washington , January 2 ) The U.S. government said today that it has no ties with the two U.S. delegations that plan to visit North Korea and hopefully may have the chance to visit the Yongbyon nuclear power station that triggered the diplomatic storm between the two countries .
While China is trying hard to get the United States , North Korea , Japan , Russia and South Korea back to the negotiation table , a delegation comprised of U.S. scholars , experts and scientists ; and another one made up of the U.S. Congressional aides are planning to visit North Korea .
Ereli , the deputy spokesman of the U.S. State Department , said : " We have nothing to do with the alleged plan of this delegation or these delegations to visit North Korea . "
Ereli said : " I think people should fully understand that these groups or individuals do not represent the government . "
One of the delegations is headed by a senior China expert from Stanford University and the nuclear scientist Hecker , former director of the Los Alamos Laboratory . Delegates include Pritchard , the State Department special convoy who negotiated with North Korea last year .
USA Today reported today that the delegation will visit the Yongbyon nuclear power station , but one delegate told APF the visit to Yongbyon is still not yet confirmed .
The visit is subject to change after its extensive media coverage . Whether this delegation will get the permission to enter North Korea remains uncertain .
The other delegation is headed by Luse , an aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lugar , and Frank Jannuzi , an aide to Biden , the chief Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
U.S. Waits for Israel Clarification on Plan of Settlements in Golan Heights
( AFP , Washington , January 2 ) The U.S. government said today that Israel hasn 't given any satisfactory answer so far to the U.S. request that Israel clarify reports of its plan to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied Golan Heights .
State Department said following the media coverage of the Wednesday ( December 31 ) incident , Israel has given its reply on the U.S. request .
However , Israel 's reply failed to completely clear the U.S. suspicions .
State Department Deputy Spokesman Ereli said : " We have already got a reply , but it is not a clear one . We are still not clear about the situation . "
He reiterated Washington 's opposition to any new Israeli settlement .
Ereli said : " We have made it very clear that we are opposed to any new settlement activity . We don 't think it is helpful , and we think it should stop . "
According to media reports , Israel plans to build nine additional settlements in the Golan Heights which it seized from Syria in 1967 , and to increase the Jewish population from 10,500 to about 15,000 in three years .
This occupying move is widely condemned by many Arab countries as illegitimate .

( AFP , Detroit , January 4 ) Toyota Motor Corp 's Prius sedan was named North American Car of the Year by journalists today at the International Auto Show in Detroit , while Ford Motor Company 's F-150 full-size pickup was chosen as Truck of the Year .

The redesigned 2004 Prius sedan is powered by gas and electricity . Marketed in October last year with a sticker price of 20,000 U.S. dollars , the initial sales have been better than expected .
Last month , Toyota Motor Corp announced a 31 % increase in production of Prius .
Press said Toyota hopes the successful debut of Prius will spur excellent sales of Highlander , a sports utility wagon also powered by gas and electricity that will go on sales later this year .
The new Highlander will be unveiled at North American International Auto Show in the coming days .
Today 's show was open to the media only .
Ford 's redesigned F-150 full-size pick-up truck , on the other hand , won the title of Truck of the Year .
According to Lyons , president of a sales division at Ford , Ford F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in the world . The 2004 F-150 has been redesigned and set the highest sales record in December last year with a total of 84,600 units sold .

Zambia to Expel British Writer Who Allegedly Insulted the President
( AFP , Lusaka , January 5 ) Zambian Interior Minister Chikapwasha said that Zambia has ordered the British writer Clarke to leave the country within 24 hours because Clarke " insulted " Zambian President Mwanawasa in his article published in the weekly column in the private newspaper the Post .
Chikapwasha told a group of Mwanawasa supporters who marched to the Interior Ministry demanding the deportation of Clarke : " Clarke will have to leave within 24 hours .
I will announce to the whole nation that we have already taken some action . "
However , when interviewed by AFP , Clarke claimed he did not receive any notice .
Clarke said : " I didn 't know at all the order of deportation has been issued . "
Mumba , the permanent secretary of the Interior Ministry , pointed out earlier that he had recommended to the interior minister to issue an order of deportation .
Mumba said : " When someone insults a country 's president , he also insults the people the president represents . He should go back and start writing about his own people . "
Clarke has lived in Zambia for many years and is married to a renowned Zambian women 's rights activist .
M 'membe , the editor of the Post , said he was willing to take the personal responsibility for the article published last Thursday and urged the Zambian government to deal with him instead of Clarke .
In the past , foreigners who allegedly insulted the president or government leaders have also been expelled from Zambia .
Junichiro Vows to Reinforce Economic Reform This Year
( AFP , Tokyo , January 5 ) At a press conference held on the first workday after the New Year 's vacation , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi vowed to move forward with the economic reform this year by saying : " Although we are still in a difficult economic situation , we finally see some sign of recovery . "
Junichiro stressed : " I 'll stick to the reform policy and continue to promote the reform .
Reinforcing the reform will lead to economic recovery . "
Junichiro said he will pay special attention this year to the Diet review on the privatization of postal service .
He said : " We are finally going to do something about the privatization of postal service which is the key to economic reform . "
Junichiro added he hopes to submit the bill regarding this plan to the Diet early next year .
Junichiro has promised to fully privatize the postal service that employs 280,000 people by 2007 .
Japan 's postal service is considered the largest bank in the world for its management of 355 trillion yen ( 3.3 trillion U.S. dollars ) of savings and insurance funds .
However , the large-scale plan still meets stiff resistance from the conservative members of the Diet .
This plan dates back from 1993 when Junichiro served as minister of postal service .
Analysts pointed out the economy in Japan is expected to maintain its steady growth of 2 % this year , but the Japanese public may still worry about further pay-cuts and lay-offs .
While many corporations continue restructuring to ensure profits , the unemployment rate in Japan is still above 5 % .
U.S. to Start Photographing and Fingerprinting Foreign Travelers Entering the Country
( AFP , Washington , January 5 ) As Singapore , home to the largest airport in Asia , endorsed deployment of armed police on airliners to counter the terrorist threats , the Unites States started the new rules today of photographing and fingerprinting foreign travelers entering the country .
Washington authorities tightened the check-ups on arriving foreign travelers at a time when concerns for global aviation safety are rapidly rising . In the last week , these concerns have forced the cancellation of several flights coming and returning to the United States .
The new photographing and fingerprinting requirements apply only to foreign visitors who must have visas to enter the United States . This type of visitors is generally expected to reach 23 million this year .
According to the Department of Homeland Security , which is in charge of implementing US-VISIT program , citizens from 28 countries , mostly European nations , are exempt from the above described procedure .
Immigration groups criticized the program as a violation on civil liberties and as a step toward creating a surveillance society . Homeland Security Secretary Ridge aggressively defended the program .
In an interview with NBC , Ridge said : " One of primary responsibilities of any government is to secure its borders . It is to do this job well that we are promoting this program . I don 't think it is obtrusive ; as a matter of fact , it takes only about 15 seconds and apparently nobody seems to mind . "
By 2005 , every port of entry on land , sea and air will be properly equipped with the photographing and fingerprinting technology .
All U.S. visas and passports will eventually include " biometric identifiers " such as photos and fingerprints .
Before the above program came into effect , the United States just raised its national terror alert in December last year .
As U.S. and North Korea Harden Their Positions , Six-nation Talks May Be Delayed till Mid-year
( AFP , Seoul , January 6 ) South Korea said today that as North Korea and the United States harden their positions , the new round of six-nation talks may be delayed till the middle of the year .
While on his way to attend a cabinet meeting in Chong Wa Dae , South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Young-kwan told reporters : " I hope this round of talks will take place in the first half of this year at the latest . "
Yoo Young-kwan made the above remark after Washington rejected Pyongyang 's recent offer of a nuclear freeze in return for major concessions and indicated both parties still need to resolve their serious disagreements prior to the nuclear talks .
Yoo Young-kwan said scheduling problems among the six participating nations have actually ruled out the possibility of reconvening the six-nation talks in January .
However , he gave no clues as to why the new round of talks can be delayed till June or later .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov attributed this to the hardened positions of the United States and North Korea .
He participated in the first round of six-nation talks held in Beijing in August last year .
Losyukov told the Interfax after his meeting with some senior Chinese officials yesterday : " The reasons are still the same old ones , ---lack of mutual trust and excessive demands set by both sides . "
After North Korea demanded once again that the United States promise concessions prior to the new round of six-nation talks , Yoon Young-kwan suggested that the talks could be delayed for a long period of time .
Washington accused Pyongyang of setting preconditions for the new round of six-nation talks .
The United States is seeking North Korea 's commitment to abolishing its nuclear weapons program .
North Korea said it will freeze its nuclear facilities if Washington lifts its economic sanctions against Pyongyang and resumes energy aid .
In the past , North Korea also insisted on signing a non-aggression treaty with the United States .

AIDS-infected Children Rejected for School Admission ; Angry Priest Director Takes Government to Court
( AFP , Nairobi , January 7 ) D 'Agostino , an outspoken U.S. priest who runs an AIDS orphanage in Nairobi , the capital of Kenya , made a daring move of taking the Kenyan government to court on behalf of infected children to force public schools into dropping their exclusion of HIV-infected children .
Although 2.5 million people are estimated to have HIV in the country , AIDS and HIV are still taboo topics in Kenya .
D 'Agostino runs the Nyumbani orphanage and takes in many HIV-positive children . He claimed that many of his charges have been denied admission to elementary schools . The practice by these school authorities is a violation of the government 's policy of obligatory universal primary education .
Namwamba , D 'Agostino 's lawyer , told the court presided over by Judge Koome : " Denying children their admission to public schools , especially those infected with HIV , is inhuman , unlawful and is a gross violation of human rights . Access to education is a basic right , and rejecting these children is a violation of their rights . "
D 'Agostino is seeking a court order to compel public schools to admit children regardless of their HIV status .
The Ministry of Education of Kenya said through its lawyer Gacivih that it was not aware of such discrimination but could understand what the schools did .
Gacivih said the Ministry of Education is willing to discuss and solve the issue with Nyumbani Children 's Home located in the northwestern suburbs of Nairobi .
Judge Koome ordered both parties to hold discussions today and report the result tomorrow .
U.S. to Release Hundreds of Iraqi Prisoners
( AFP , Baghdad ) Bremer , the US-appointed provisional authority administrator in Iraq announced in his policy address today that the U.S.-led occupying coalition will release 100 Iraqi prisoners on the 8th and hundreds more will regain their freedom in the coming weeks .
Bremer , accompanied by Pachachi , chairman of Iraqi Interim Governing Council , also revealed a new reward program which offers up to 200,000 U.S. dollars for anyone who assists the authorities in capturing each of the remaining fugitives on the most wanted list .
Pachachi praised the occupying coalition for making the aforementioned move and claimed it as a result of the Governing Council 's aggressive lobbying .
Pachachi told reporters : " The Governing Council has long been committed to spreading the spirit of reconciliation among the Iraqi people . In order to achieve this goal , we asked the coalition to review the issue of prisoners . "
The coalition spokesman , who declined to be named , said later that a total of 506 prisoners are scheduled to be released in the coming weeks .
Bremer told reporters in his brief address : " The coalition will release the first 100 prisoners tomorrow . "
Bremer made this gesture of reconciliation at a time when the occupying coalition is making every effort to appease pent-up grudges of the Sunnis to which Hussein belonged .
Hussein was captured alive by the U.S. military eight months after he was on the run .
Bremer said : " Hussein the tyrant has now become a prisoner . Most of his henchmen are either killed or captured . Now it time for reconciliation . "
Prisoners are to be released on the condition that they " must renounce violence " and find prominent people in the community or religious and tribal leaders as their guarantors to be responsible for their good conduct .
Bremer said none of those to be released have been directly involved in attacks on American forces or other deadly attacks nor have they been involved in any torture or crimes against humanity .
Bremer said that those to be released " have made a mistake and have now repented , " and " we are prepared to give some of them a chance to start anew . "

U.S. Openly Backs Building ITER in Japan
( AFP , Tokyo , January 10 ) For the first time , the United States openly backs the choice of Japan 's Aomori Prefecture as the site for building a multi-billion-dollar ITER over the town of Cadarache in France , claiming Japan can provide a superior site for its construction .
For the ITER project , either Cadarache in France or Rokkasho-Mura in Aomori Prefecture of northern Japan will be chosen as its site for construction .
The project aims to provide a testing ground for the simulation of solar nuclear fusion , which is prized as the cleanest , safest , inexhaustible energy source of the future .
However , it is generally estimated that the above project will not be able to generate electricity before 2050 .

Your renowned technology and engineering expertise are the admiration of the world . In addition , the local community has expressly welcomed this project and is trying its best for Rokkasho-Mura to win the bidding . "
A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Tokyo confirmed that this is the first time that Washington has openly backed Japan in its bidding for hosting ITER .
Officials at Japan 's MEXT said : " We 're greatly encouraged by Abraham 's speech .
We 'll continue to cooperate with other countries so that ITER will be constructed in Rokkasho-Mura . "

Shaaban pointed out Katsav 's move is not " a serious response " to President Assad 's call last month to resume contact with Israel and accused President Katsav of merely seeking media coverage .
The government news agency SANA quoted an unidentified senior official who accused the Israeli president of trying to sidestep the Middle East peace process based on the principle of land for peace ,
The official said : " It is not a matter of visits or taking initiatives ; what Israel said recently is meant to sidestep the peace process . "
The official added : " Any plans or measures for partial solutions will not bring peace to the Middle East . "
In the previous negotiations with King Assad Sr. , Assad 's late father , the then Israeli Prime Minister Barak agreed to withdraw almost completely from the Golan Heights , keeping only a narrow corridor bordering the eastern bank of the Sea of Galilee .
However , Damascus rejected the proposal , hoping Israel would return the entire Golan Heights which Israel seized in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981 .
Rift Deepens in Command System of Largest Rebel Group in Liberia
( AFP , Monrovia , January 12 ) After LURD leader Conneh was ousted , fighting for control over this major rebel group in Liberia intensified . A rebel leader insists that Conneh is still in charge .
LURD held an uprising against the former President Taylor 's regime in 1999 , starting a four-year civil war in Liberia and eventually controlling about four-fifths of the country territory .
In mid-August last year , Taylor agreed to go in exile in Nigeria , paving the way for an agreement on peace and coalition government to be reached in this country . Pursuant to the agreement , the former government , rebel forces and opposition parties formed a transitional government .
However , a group calling itself LURD 's " military high command " accused Conneh of trading LURD 's position in the transitional government for money and announced the other day that they have chosen Aisha Keita Conneh , Conneh 's estranged wife , to replace Conneh as the leader .
But Dweh , current speaker of the transitional parliament and founder of LURD , insisted that only LURD 's national executive committee has the power to remove the leader of the organization .
He told the media the night before last night : " I founded LURD in Nigeria . I can pledge to Liberian people that there is no rift in LURD , and nothing can undermine the peace process . "
Dweh attributed LURD 's internal dispute to the behind-the-scenes manipulations by Bryant , head of the transitional government , and other senior LURD leaders who hold positions in the transitional government .
Bryant , a former businessman , was appointed last October to lead the war-torn country till the presidential election in 2005 .
Dweh accused the justice minister , transport minister and labor minister of conspiring with Aisha Conneh with Bryant 's support and promising her the leadership of LURD once Conneh was ousted .
He warned that if Bryant continues to violate the peace agreement , the warring factions will return to Accra where the peace agreement was drafted to discuss in a meeting whether it is possible to recall Bryant .
Former U.S. Boxer Alleges Boxing Promotion Company Bribed Him to Take a Dive
( AFP , New York , January 12 ) The New York Daily News reported the former U.S. boxer Rose said he was offered 5,000 U.S. dollars to take a dive by employees from Top Rank , the promotion company for U.S. professional boxing matches .
Top Rank run by Arum is now under the FBI investigation .
The 34-year-old Rose said two representatives from Top Rank came to his home a few weeks prior to his boxing match with his compatriot Esch nicknamed " Butterbean " in December 1995 .
Rose told the newspaper : " In the early afternoon , I was resting at home when someone knocked on my door . I looked through the peephole and saw two white Top Rank employees . They wanted to talk with me about the match with Butterbean . "
" They said : We 've brought some money for you . It is quite a substantial sum , and they wanted me to take a dive and not to beat Butterbean . "
Rose told the investigators about the 1995 incident as part of the 20-month investigation of the corruption in the U.S. boxing circle .
Rose refused to take the bribe and defeated Esch , who had not been beaten before , in the second round of the boxing match held at Madison Square Garden .
The New York Daily News reached Esch in his residence in Alabama and asked him if he believed Rose 's story . Esch defended Top Rank , saying : " Rose was overmatched . Why would you ask a boxer with a record of 1-6 to take a dive ? I don 't think Top Rank would do anything illegal . "
The FBI raided Top Rank headquarters in Las Vegas on the 6th and confiscated its financial and medical documents and computers .
The report said the FBI was also collecting evidence of fight fixing , including the championship fight between Mosley and Hoya in September .
U.S. Hopes Asian Countries Will Get over Fear of Mad Cow Disease
( AFP , Manila , January 14 ) The U.S. agricultural officials said although the United States reported a case of mad cow disease last month , Asian countries can safely consume U.S. beef soon .
Though the United States stepped up safety inspection the moment the first case of mad cow disease was found in the country , several Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea still immediately banned or restricted the import of U.S. beef .
U.S. officials said yesterday that relevant agencies have expanded the probe of mad cow disease . The beef produced in the place where the mad cow disease was originally found has not been exported . In addition , the relevant agencies have been reinforcing the inspection in the past ten years to prevent any outbreak of mad cow disease .
Mad cow disease , also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , is linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , a disorder that leads to brain degeneration in humans .
Greene , regional director for Asia of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , said at a press conference in Manila : " We 're very optimistic that in a month or so , these Asian countries will further scale down the current ban . "
Greene Added : " We have assured all Asian countries about the safety of U.S. beef . "
He said that a Japanese delegation is currently visiting the United States to learn first hand how the United States is preventing the mad cow disease .
South Korea Steps up Quarantine against Spread of Bird Flu
( AFP , Seoul , January 14 ) South Korean officials said that after a lull of nine days , a new outbreak of bird flu is again reported in South Korea . South Korea has stepped up quarantine efforts to prevent the bird flu from further spreading .
South Korea 's Department of Agriculture said that a tight quarantine zone has been established near a chicken farm in Yangsan , 390 kilometers southeast of Seoul .
Officials from Ministry of Health detected the bird flu virus in this zone on Monday .
It is the first time in nine days that South Korea has confirmed the discovery of the bird flu virus .
Last month , the bird flu hit 15 areas in South Korea . After the authorities were forced to slaughter nearly 2 million chickens and ducks , the highly contagious poultry disease was apparently contained .
Kim Chang-Seob , head of animal health division of South Korea 's Ministry of Health , said : " We are culling all the chickens in the affected area and strictly restricting the movement of the poultry . "
The new case of bird flu has prompted South Korean government officials to step up quarantine efforts in other areas .
Kim Chang-Seob said that this bird flu virus can survive in dust for two weeks and at least for 35 days in poultry excrement .
Bush Barely Keeps Plans for a Free Trade Area at Americas Summit
( AFP , Mexico , Monterrey , January 13 ) The plan to establish a free trade area of the Americas next year ambitiously promoted by the U.S. President Bush won the grudging support from the leaders of other 33 nations at the Summit of the Americas today .
However , participating nations were divided on the issue of how to combat aggravating poverty in the western hemisphere , and the United States also failed to include an anti-corruption clause in the final communique .
The free trade area of the Americas , stretching from Alaska on the north to Argentina on the south , will be the largest of its kind in the world with a market of about 800 million people and a gross domestic product of up to 13 trillion U.S. dollars .
However , at the close of the two-day summit , Argentine President Kirchner attacked the U.S. plan in his speech , saying that establishing a free trade area alone cannot solve the problems of the Americas .
Brazil , the largest economy in South America , and Venezuela , the chief oil supplier for the United States , were both opposed to the inclusion of the Free Trade Area of the Americas into the summit agenda . It was not until after heated discussions that leaders of all the nations finally agreed in a declaration to complete the negotiation on establishing the Free Trade Area of the Americas by January 2005 .
As Political Struggle Escalates in Iran , Reformists Warn Government May Resign En Masse
( AFP , Tehran , January 13 ) Reformists in Iran escalated their fight with powerful conservatives over their disqualification from the parliamentary election today . Some top cabinet ministers threatened to resign en masse unless conservatives make concessions on the issue of barring reformist candidates from participating in the election .
Sattarifar , one of vice presidents , warned that the entire government may resign if it fails to foil Guardian Council 's attempt to disqualify thousands of candidates from running for the parliamentary election on February 20 .
Sattarifar said : " If the government finds it impossible to do its duty of protecting citizens ' rights and holding free elections , continuing to rule will not be an option . "
Governors of 27 administrative provinces in Iran have already said that they will resign en masse . According to sources close to President Khatami , at least 10 ministers are ready for resignations .
However , Khatami 's aide denied the media 's allegation that the moderate President Khatami is preparing to resign .
Indignant reformist MPs continued their sit-in in the parliament building for the third day , claiming they would not mind sitting in for weeks if necessary .
83 of the reformist MPs , being disqualified , are unable to run for their second term .
IRNA said that MPs have contested Guardian Council , urging it to repeal the aforementioned ruling of disqualification .
Guardian Council , a non-elected political supervisory body comprised of 12 people , is also a stronghold of anti-reform religious right-wing forces .
Ms. Ebadi , Iran 's Nobel peace laureate who is always hated by hard-liners , also said she will pay a visit to the parliament to express her support for the sit-in of reformist MPs .
Rising New Zealand Dollar Has No Effect on Business Confidence in New Zealand
( AFP , Wellington , January 15 ) According to the latest quarterly survey released by New Zealand Institute of Economic Research , business confidence in New Zealand remains high despite the negative impact caused by the rising value of New Zealand dollar .
The survey found only two percent of companies are pessimistic about business conditions in the next six months in contrast with 3 percent and 20 percent respectively for the previous two quarters .
The above institute said that according to all indicators of the survey , the fourth quarter of last year registered a steady economic growth with an increase of 31 % in businesses ' own activities .
However , based on forward looking indicators , the economic growth in New Zealand is expected to " continue its gentle decline in the coming quarters . "
Gardiner , an economist at New Zealand Institute of Economic Research , said that in the past three months the soaring New Zealand dollar has resulted in a widened confidence gap between exporters and non-exporters .
11 percent of exporters in the manufacturing and construction sectors expect the conditions to deteriorate in the next six months , while 14 percent of non-exporters feel optimistic about their business prospects in the next six months .
The New Zealand dollar has appreciated 30 % in the past two years .
Worries Arise as Adecco CFO and North American Unit Executive Resign
( AFP , Zurich , January 16 ) As Weber , the chief financial officer and head of U.S. operations at Adecco , the world 's largest temporary staffing agency , resigned after the company was reported to have accounting problems , worries arise that another corporate scandal is just about to unfold .
This week , Weber just played down Adecco delay of the publication of the company annual financial reports which , originally due for release on February 4 , was postponed due to the discovery of major weaknesses in internal controls of Adecco business operations at its North American unit .
Weber will be replaced by financial controller Cano on an interim basis .
Adecco Staffing chief executive Arrieta also resigned and will be replaced by Marcel , chairman of Adecco France , the group 's single largest national unit overseas .
In addition , the former chief executive Bowmer , who had stepped down to take the more advisory position of chairman , will now resume his charge of actual management of this troubled company , allowing the current chief executive Caille to " devote himself exclusively to day-to-day business operations . "
Traders said that changes in Adecco top-level personnel once again put the company shares under pressure to sell .
At 9 : 40 , Adecco shares dropped 3.6 % , a slight leveling off from the sharp plunge at opening , while the broader Swiss Market made a small gain of 20.3 points .
After Adecco announced a delay in the publication of its annual financial reports on Monday , its shares tumbled into turmoil .
Japan Targets Balanced Budget in 10 Years
( AFP , Tokyo , January 16 ) Japan 's Minister of Finance Sadakazu Tanigaki said today he was highly confident the world 's second-largest economy will be able to get out of a " fiscal crisis " and put public finances in order within 10 years .
Sadakazu Tanigaki said the total combined deficits of the central and local governments , which have reached 5 % of Japan 's GDP , could be eliminated within 10 years if they are reduced by an average of 0.5 % each year .
He told a group of reporters : " Japan 's fiscal condition is still in a crisis .
As far as ( fiscal ) flow and reserve are concerned , we fare the worst among the major industrialized countries . "
Japan officially set the target of turning " primary deficits " into a " primary surplus " in the fiscal year ending in March 2014 -- the first time in more than two decades that multi-level public finances will have been balanced .
This is the first time that the government led by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has given Japan a clear target of regaining the " primary surplus , " under which tax revenues exceed expenditures minus debt-service expenses .
Japan last had such a surplus in the fiscal year ending in March 1992 which concluded the sequence of 6 years of surpluses .

Death Toll Reaches 41,000 for Earthquake in Ancient City of Bam in Iran
( AFP , Tehran , January 16 ) A spokesman for Khamenei , Iran 's supreme religious leader , said today that the death toll has reached 41,000 for the massive earthquake that hit the ancient city of Bam on December 26 last year and the final figure may climb up to 45,000 .
However , the previous estimate for the death toll was between 30,000 and 35,000 .
Mohammadi-Gholpayghani , head of Khamenei 's office , told Iran 's state news agency ( IRNA ) : " Up until now , 41,000 have been killed in the Bam earthquake , and the final death toll could reach 45,000 . "
IRNA quoted him as saying : " This is a tragic catastrophe . "
At the same time , he vowed that the government will speed up the reconstruction .
Some 30,000 people were injured in the Bam earthquake .
A high-level provincial official said today it will take two years to rebuild the city of Bam and currently the government has already invited Iranian and foreign companies to bid for the reconstruction .
Thousands March in Paris in Anti-nuclear Demonstration
( AFP , Paris , January 17 ) As many as 15,000 anti-nuclear protestors marched in Paris against a new generation of reactors , accusing the police of creating trouble by allowing another rally in protest of the ban on religious headdresses in schools .
The main target of these anti-nuclear demonstrations is the European Pressurized Water Reactor ( EPWR ) . The first reactor of this kind will be built in Finland by a financial consortium that includes the French state-owned Areva group and the German engineering giant Siemens at a cost of 3 billion euros ( 3.7 billion U.S. dollars ) .
France , one of the countries most dependent on nuclear energy in the world , is expected to approve this reactor in the near future and to start replacing some of the 58 nuclear power plants that generate 80 % of the nation 's electricity and that are near the end of their services .
Lhomme , a spokesman for the group called End Nuclear Network which organized the demonstration , said : " In fact , what we see before us is an actual revival of nuclear energy . "
Lhomme criticized the police for allowing another rally , saying : " We believe the Interior Ministry is looking for trouble . "
The French Interior Ministry manages policing in all cities .
The rally was held at the same location in Paris at nearly the same time and attracted thousands of participants in protest against the government 's plan to ban Islamic headdresses and other " conspicuous " religious symbols in schools .
The organizers claimed the number of anti-nuclear protestors exceeded 15,000 , while the police estimated it was less than 6,000 . They built a pyramid of tin cans in the square and denounced what they called the " radioactive waste scandal left for future generations . "

( AFP , Baghdad , January 18 ) According to the U.S. military and the Iraqi hospitals , the death toll in a suicide car bombing that blew up the gate to the headquarters of the U.S. military in Baghdad this morning has risen to 23 while the number of the wounded people has also increased to 95 .
Dr. Juma at Karrama Hospital said : " We have taken in three dead and 30 wounded . "
The latest report of casualties added three more to the death toll .
A U.S. military spokesman said earlier that a U.S. military affiliated hospital reported 18 were dead and 28 were wounded . Among the dead , 16 were Iraqi civilians and two were American nationals employed by U.S. Defense Department .
In addition , an emergency doctor said two were dead at Yarmuk Hospital in Baghdad .

The aforementioned military spokesman confirmed that those wounded people being treated in the U.S. military hospital were respectively 22 Iraqi civilians , 4 American contractors and 2 U.S. soldiers .
It is unknown at this moment whether the above death toll includes the suicide bomber .
Shrinking Workforce Bound to Impact Economic Output in EU and Japan
( AFP , Davos , Switzerland , January 19 ) A study released today by World Economic Forum ( WEF ) and the U.S. consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide pointed out that due to its shrinking workforce , the European Union 's share of the global economic output will have decreased by nearly half by 2050 .
In contrast , the abundant labor force in developing countries such as India and China should be able to help boost economic growth .
Sammans , the executive chairman of Watson Wyatt Worldwide , said : " Workforce growth and productivity will determine economic output .
In countries with great labor shortage , supplies of goods and services may not be able to meet the demand and living standards . "
The study entitled " Living More Happily : Economic Impact on Aging Societies " pointed out that thanks to advances in medicine which increase human life expectancy , the population of retirees , as compared with that of workforce , continues to grow ( especially in developed countries ) and this will be bound to have a direct impact on economic output .
The statement in response to the study noted : " Assuming there is no change in the current demographics and economic trends , by 2050 the EU 's share of the global economic output will have decreased from the current 18 % to 10 % . "
The statement also warned : " Japan 's share will have shrunk from 8 % to 4 % . "
Israel 's Ambassador to Sweden Vandalizes Artwork , Triggering Diplomatic Dispute between Two Countries
( AFP , Stockholm , January 18 ) The spat caused by the vandalization of a piece of artwork commemorating a Palestinian suicide bomber in Sweden 's Museum of National History by Mazel , Israeli ambassador to Sweden , evolved into a full-scale diplomatic dispute today when Israeli Prime Minister Sharon intervened .
Ambassador Mazel visited the art show in Stockholm 's Museum of Antiquities last Friday . When he saw a piece of artwork featuring a photo of the suicide bomber in the Haifa incident in October last year , he deliberately vandalized the work , causing himself to be kicked out by the museum authorities and triggering a diplomatic clash between Israel and Sweden .
Israel 's demand that Sweden disassemble the artwork has been rejected by Sweden .
After the incident , it was widely reported by the Swedish newspapers .
The exhibition is part of an upcoming international conference on genocide to be hosted by the Swedish government , and Israel is going to attend the conference .
The on-site video-taping shows that the Israeli ambassador yanked out a spotlight at the conference site and threw it into water , causing the artwork to short-circuit . After this , the curator of the museum ordered Ambassador Mazel to leave the property .
Israeli Prime Minister Sharon expressed his support for Mazel today , turning the incident into a full-scale diplomatic dispute .
The artwork on exhibit is mainly composed of a boat named " Snow White " sailing on the sea with a photo of a smiling Hanadi Jaradat placed on the bow as a sail .
Hanadi was a Palestinian intern lawyer living in Israel . To avenge her younger brother who was killed in a bombing by Israelis , she blew herself up in a suicide bombing attack in Haifa in northern Israel in October last year , killing 21 Israelis and setting off a new wave of Israeli-Palestinian clashes .
Mazel said : " I could not tolerate this artwork , which is also an insult to the families of the victims in the Haifa incident . As Israeli ambassador , I could not remain indifferent to such a work that distorts reality . "
Democrats Cite Baghdad Bombing as Evidence of Failure of U.S. Policy on Iraq
( AFP , Washington , January 18 ) U.S. Democratic candidates seeking to replace Bush in the White House all pointed out today that the latest bloody suicide bombing attack in Baghdad is evidence of the failure of U.S. policy on Iraq .
The attack , killing at least 25 and wounding about 30 , was the bloodiest attack in Baghdad since the U.S. occupation of Iraq .
Bush 's Democratic opponents have harshly criticized his Iraq policy . Some of them said the attack was the latest proof of the failure of Bush 's Iraq policy .
Senator Edwards of North Carolina told CBS : " Our current policy is a failure , and I wonder why the government does not want to change course . "
He said : " Obviously , the first thing we need to do is to internationalize the security force in Iraq . The other thing is to turn the transitional government over to the United Nations . "
In a public appearance with the Democratic candidate Dean , the former President Carter said the U.S.-led Iraq war " has proved it was not only based on incorrect intelligence and misleading statements , " but the latest attack " has also demonstrated on a continuous basis that this is a tragedy . "
Dean has made opposition to the Iraq war a centerpiece of his campaign .
Iraqi Guerrillas Use High-tech Weapons Against U.S. Helicopters
( AFP , Washington , January 18 ) Senior U.S. military officials said that Iraqi insurgents are using increasingly sophisticated weapons to attack U.S. helicopters .
A group of senior officials familiar with a classified military report told The New York Times today that the findings in the classified military study show the Iraqi guerrillas have used rocket-propelled grenades and the more advanced heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles to attack U.S. helicopters .
They said the study was conducted prior to the three Iraqi attacks on U.S. helicopters this month . However , the three most recent attacks would only reinforce the conclusion of the study .
The military study mainly aims at providing U.S. pilots ways of evading attacks by Iraqi guerrillas using such weapons . The officials would not discuss new findings .
However , given the methodology used in this new wave of attacks in Iraq , it is troubling to find that the Iraqi guerrillas have carefully studied the modes of combat of the U.S. aircraft .
What was even more troubling , the researchers found , was that the Iraqi guerrillas have used SA-16 shoulder-fired missiles on more than one occasion .
This type of missile with its precision guidance system is very hard for pilots to evade .
A senior U.S. military aviator in the Persian Gulf region said : " Every time our aircraft is shot down , it is a big strategic victory for our enemy .
It not only makes headline news but also announces the instant winner . Therefore , the enemy thinks it is a very useful trick . "
Nine U.S. helicopters have been shot down or have crashed since October 25 last year , killing at least 49 U.S. soldiers .
Carter Praises Dean on Eve of U.S. Democratic Caucuses in Iowa
( AFP , Plains , Georgia , January 18 ) On the eve of the first face-off among the Democratic presidential candidates at the party caucuses in Iowa , the former U.S. President Carter praised the candidate Dean , the former governor of Vermont , for his " courageous and outspoken " opposition to the Iraq war .
In his hometown of Plains , Georgia , Carter told reporters : " I 've been particularly grateful to the courageous and outspoken stance and position Governor Dean has taken from the very beginning . "
The Nobel peace laureate said : " In the past year and a half , I spent a lot of time strongly opposing this totally unnecessary and unjust Iraq war .
Despite my utmost efforts , the war has started , and now it is proven that the war was based on erroneous intelligence and misleading statements and a sustained demonstration of a tragedy . "
Carter praised Dean as a staunch " advocate for peace . " Though he did not officially endorse Dean in his statement , his remark above was reported by all TV networks in the United States .
As a left-leaning former governor of a northern state , Dean could be at a disadvantage in the South when facing the centrist retired general Clark from Arkansas , but Carter 's support may increase his chances of winning in the conservative and religion-conscious southern states .
In a recent television interview , Carter said he considered Dean as most likely Democratic candidate to run against Bush .
Democrats Attack Bush for Creating New Axis of Evil
( AFP , Washington , January 21 ) On the evening of the 20th , U.S. opposition Democrats accused President Bush of leading the United States into isolation from the rest of the world and creating a new " axis of evil " with his policies .
When Democrats rebroadcast the president 's State of Union address , House Democratic leader Pelosi lashed out on the human and financial costs caused by last year 's military invasion of Iraq .
With the upcoming U.S. presidential election ( U.S. presidential election is to be held on November 2 this year ) , Democrats are attacking Bush with greater intensity .
Clark , one of the major contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination , said that Bush has created his own " axis of evil . "
Bush coined the phrase of " axis of evil " two years ago in his State of Union address to describe some countries that threaten the United States .
Clark said : " That is the axis of fiscal policies that threaten our future , foreign policies that threaten our security and domestic policies that put an end to families . "
U.S. Again Urges Iranian Authorities to Allow Free and Fair Parliamentary Election
( AFP , Washington , January 21 ) As the political crisis between Iran 's religious conservatives and reformists over the qualification of parliamentary candidates continues to escalate , the United States again urged Iran to ensure that the upcoming February election be free and fair .
State Department Deputy Spokesman Ereli said : " We think it is important that Iranian leaders allow free and fair election through an electoral process that meets international standards and that Iranian government must respond to the needs of its people . "
Ireli said : " The political situation in Iran is evolving . There are many developments each day and we are closely watching the situation . "
Ereli made the above remark when asked by reporters about the resignations of Iran 's cabinet ministers and vice presidents .
According to reports , several cabinet ministers and vice presidents in Iranian President Khatami 's reformist government handed in their resignations in a protest against the mass disqualification of reformist candidates for the parliamentary election to be held on the 20th of next month .
Small Plane Crashes into Residential Area in Japan , Killing Three on Board
( AFP , Tokyo , January 22 ) A small plane crashed into a residential area in Yamanashi Prefecture in central Japan today , killing all three people on board . Fortunately , the nearby homes , a kindergarten and a hospital were all " miraculously " spared .
Yamamoto , an emergency official at the Yamanashi prefectural government , said the single-engine Cessna 172p piloted by a 32-year-old crashed into a small parking lot in the area .
One of the passengers who died in the accident was a photographer . He was taking aerial pictures of children lining up in formation of letters outside a local kindergarten .
The kindergarten is only 100 meters away from the site of the plane crash .
Yamamoto said : " The small plane crashed right next to a few houses and a hospital . All three on board were killed .
It is really a miracle that this plane did not crash into the houses or the hospital .
At the time , there was a strong wind and the oil was leaking . If the plane had crashed into the houses or the hospital ,
it would have certainly caused a huge fire . "
An aviation official at the Transport Ministry said the plane took off this morning from Chofu Airport in western Tokyo and was scheduled to return in two hours .
As of the moment , the cause of the accident is not yet clear .
Contact with Mars Rover Spirit Lost , Says NASA
( AFP , Washington , January 22 ) NASA officials said today that the agency has lost contact with the U.S. exploration rover Spirit that has landed on Mars due to a serious problem on the rover .
Theisinger , project manager of the Mars exploration rover mission , said : " We found there is a very serious anomaly on the rover . "
NASA said yesterday that scientists were unable to send daily instructions to Spirit because of thunder and lightning over Australia .
However , experts now believe it is a more serious problem that has caused the breakdown in communications .
The Spirit exploration rover arrived on Mars on January 3 and started its search last week for signs of past life on the red planet .
Its twin rover , " Opportunity , " is scheduled to land at night between January 24 and January 25 .
This mission of exploration costs 820 million U.S. dollars and it was originally expected that both solar-powered rovers could operate for about three months .
U.S. Optimistic about Resuming Talks with North Korea After Conferring with Japan and South Korea
( AFP , Washington , January 22 ) The United States said today it is " very optimistic " about resuming the multi-nation talks as soon as possible to end the North Korea nuclear stalemate . However , the United States also said only some slight progress has been made in getting Pyongyang back to the negotiation table .
Kelly , the top U.S. diplomat in charge of Asia Pacific affairs , said : " We think there is a great chance of resuming six-nation talks soon , but at this time we have not got any specific date . "
Kelly had consulted with senior officials of Japan and South Korea on North Korea 's nuclear developments . He said there is still a great chance of holding the second round of talks , which will eventually make North Korea agree to dismantle its nuclear programs .
Kelly told reporters : " We think there is a very good chance of resuming six-nation talks . "
However , he said the agreement to be reached should be highly comprehensive , including Pyongyang 's verifiable pledges to eliminate completely its uranium enrichment program , plutonium reprocessing and existing atomic weapons .
North Korea had shown to the non-official U.S. representatives what they called plutonium , but denied having any uranium enrichment program , refuting the U.S. allegation that Pyongyang admitted to having a uranium enrichment program at the 2002 talks .
WHO Confirms the Sixth Death from Bird Flu in Vietnam
( AFP , Hanoi , January 24 ) WHO confirmed today the sixth death from bird flu in Vietnam as a 13-year-old boy from Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam died after contracting avian influenza virus .
This is the first confirmed case of death from bird flu in southern Vietnam .
Vietnamese health officials announced earlier to the public the sixth death from bird flu , raising the death toll from the virus in Vietnam to at least six and triggering the world concern that the virus is further spreading to humans .
The boy earlier tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus and was therefore confirmed as having contracted the virus .
Nguyen The Dung , director of health department of Ho Chi Minh City , told AFP today that the boy died on January 22 in No. 2 Children 's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City .
He was sent to the hospital for respiratory symptoms on the 19th .
WHO also said it is monitoring the development of the outbreak closely with Vietnam authorities .
Another Vietnamese official said two sisters also died of a severe respiratory disease in a hospital in Hanoi on the 22nd . Health authorities suspect the two were also victims of bird flu .
Bird Flu Hits Millions of Chickens in Indonesia
( AFP , Jakarta , January 25 ) Indonesia 's Ministry of Agriculture announced today that an outbreak of bird flu has caused the death of millions of chickens but no cases of human infection have been reported so far .
Sudarjat , director for animal husbandry of Ministry of Agriculture , told the public not to panic since no humans in Indonesia have so far been infected with this potentially deadly disease .
Outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in seven countries in Asia so far and six people have already died of the disease in Vietnam .
Indonesian officials said earlier that the bird flu which infected most of poultry on Java and Bali islands last November was Newcastle disease .
As late as this morning , Priyono , spokesman for Ministry of Agriculture , was still saying there was no sign yet of any bird flu in Indonesia .
He told AFP in the evening it is still not yet certain whether this outbreak is caused by the H5N1 virus .
Most of the deaths from bird flu in Vietnam were caused by the H5N1 virus .
The spokesman said a combination of Newcastle disease and Type A bird flu has killed 4.7 million fowls since last November .
About 60 % of them died of Newcastle disease .
He said no order has been issued yet for an immediate culling .
Quoting Sudarjat , Indonesia 's state news agency reported that authorities have conducted tests using serums from the UK and Australia to determine the strain of virus , but the results will not be available until Wednesday or Thursday . The government will then send the report to the relevant international organizations .
Snow over Western and Northern Europe Wreaks Havoc to Traffic and Transport
( AFP , Paris , January 29 ) Blizzard has covered most of western and northern Europe , disrupting traffic and railroad transport and forcing hundreds of flight cancellations in Britain , Germany and Denmark .
In London , a spokesman for Heathrow Airport said that last night 's snow drifts caused over 200 flight cancellations at the airport and suspended another 80 flights early this morning .
Gatwick and Stansted , two other airports near London , are also affected by the snow drifts and a total of 18 flights have been canceled due to the weather .
In Germany , the wintry weather led to the cancellation of at least 60 flights to Frankfurt International Airport , the largest airport in the country .
Transport authorities said dozens of other flights to Frankfurt were delayed and the air traffic may be affected by the weather for the rest of the day today .
In France , restrictions on road traffic went into force in Paris after an overnight snowfall , but similar measures in other parts of the country were lifted this morning .
All services are reportedly back to near normal at major airports in Paris . Yesterday , a combination of snow and fog led to a series of delays at de Gaulle Airport .
However , airport authorities in Paris advised air travelers to check whether their flights will be on schedule before leaving home .
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast , most of France is covered in white snow .
Taiwan and Japan , both being democracies , should regard it as their obligation or even as a responsibility to make joint efforts toward consolidating democracy in Asia .
In order to promote democratic values , the government in our country will establish the " Taiwan Democracy Foundation " in the coming days with the cooperation of international political parties as one of its focuses .
Through this foundation , the Democratic Progress Party hopes to work together with democratic parties in other countries , share its experience of promoting democracy with other countries and make its contribution to the peace , stability and prosperity in Asia so that our ideal of establishing " Asian Democratic Alliance " will be realized as soon as possible .
In a rapidly changing world , a slightest shift in the balance of power in the region would affect the entire area , putting the security of all countries under test .
In the Asia Pacific region , North Korea , complacent about its possession of nuclear weapons , has repeatedly test-fired missiles that flew over Japan airspace since the United States started the war on Iraq last month . In addition , China has long been actively expanding its military arsenal and has deployed ballistic missiles aiming at Taiwan .
All this has posed grave threats to the security of Taiwan and Japan as well as the rest of Asia Pacific region .
These issues concerning the consolidation of democracy and safeguarding of security need formal security mechanisms before they can be discussed and resolved .
Since today 's symposium is the first official dialogue on security between the DPP , the ruling party of Taiwan , and the Liberal Democratic Party , the ruling party of Japan and parliament members of other political parties , its importance is self-evident .
I myself also hope that in addition to the bilateral dialogue between Taiwan and Japan , the United States , Japan , South Korea and other neighboring countries in the Asia Pacific region will in the future be able to jointly promote the establishment of " security dialogue mechanism " and also support Taiwan participation in the multilateral dialogue organizations in the region so as to implement the idea of " cooperative security . "
This is an important moment today that encourages us to continue pushing forward with the reform . We hereby express our appreciation in acknowledgement of all the efforts by our party members in demonstrating the will of this party and their joint efforts in achieving the goals of the reform .
" The withdrawal of political parties from radio and television stations " is not only the most basic requirement for the implementation of media reform but also a concept the DPP has always adhered to . That our party is in power should mean the reform will be accelerated , not that we become a hurdle or a burden to the reform .
We also understand that in order to promote this goal , elected public officials in our party should take the lead in withdrawing themselves from media businesses . This will be a small step toward media reform but it will also be a crucial step .
During the era of the martial law when media was monopolized , many party members , in order to gain access to open public forum , engaged themselves in such difficult tasks as establishing the fourth TV station and local radio stations , through which they hoped to break the existing restrictions and help promote the reform of the media environment .
For example , Comrade Trong Chai spent much time and energy in those days in establishing the fourth terrestrial television station and eventually founded " Formosa Television . "
This action brought a significant impact on the entire media environment particularly in that it shattered the longtime monopoly of the three stations and provided more space for the development of cable television stations .
However , we must understand that due to the historical limitation , there were many things that were done because they had to be done in the course of promoting the reform . Therefore , when the media is completely open and free today , it means we have accomplished the mission set for that phase . To allow the reform to continue its course , we must make choices as to what to keep and what to sacrifice .
The Central Standing Committee declared that all elected public officials in our party should withdraw themselves completely from their media businesses by the next session of the Legislative Yuan , namely , September 5 , so as to set an example of fulfilling their promise to the people .
We are very much pleased that all of you can give priority to the ideal and goal of the Party . People like Trong Chai , Chang Chun-hung , Chou Ching-yu , Hou Shui-sheng , Kao Meng-ting , Huang Nai-hui and Shen Ming-kung and others , who made a great deal of contribution during the democratic movement , are all able to sacrifice their minor individual interest in favor of promoting the media reform .
Ruling does not mean enjoying power , but assuming more responsibilities .
Despite setbacks and bumpy progress it has encountered since it took power , the Democratic Progressive Party has always managed to turn challenges into motivation for making progress and has steadily led Taiwan in deepening democratization while keeping in line with universal values of global democracy , peace and prosperity .
This is because it is always our belief that only people are the masters of this country , and the DPP 's duty is to elevate the party 's founding principles of " integrity , diligence and love for the homeland " to the bright vision of " reform , progress and good life , " and lay the foundation for a lasting peace and stability for 23 million Taiwanese people .
For a long time , the DPP has played a role of " government performing multiple functions in promoting Taiwan 's diplomacy and has achieved brilliant results .
Despite China constant diplomatic pressure and military threats , we have never caved in , because we have grasped our fate in our own hands , and despite the absence of rich resources , the DPP has made small but steady progress in expanding space for Taiwan participation in international affairs .
" Diversified diplomacy " is the centerpiece of the DPP 's overall diplomatic strategy . In the past year , we used " Council of Asian Liberals & Democrats " as a platform and successfully shared our experience with other countries in East Asia and communicated with other political parties on issues of the region economic challenges , democratic reform of political parties , eradication of mercenary politics , solutions to poverty resulting from globalization , political propaganda vs. communication and participation of young people in the government and other related topics .
In March of next year , I myself will officially assume chairmanship of council of Asian Liberals & Democrats , and I hope that in the capacity of a leader of an international organization , I can create more opportunities for Taiwan to contribute more to the international community .
In addition , the DPP has also actively involved in the affairs of liberal International after becoming its official member last year .
Apart from sending staff to serve as human rights commissioners in the secretariat of its headquarters in London , we will also cooperate with other member parties and hold seminars on political reforms in Central and South America , Europe and other regions .
On September 28 , our party celebrated its 17th birthday .
The 17-year-old Democratic Progressive Party has followed all the way its ideal of democracy and has been filled with strength for reforms and progress .
We have won the trust of Taiwanese people because we are always on the side of democratic reforms . It is also for this reason that our responsibility and mission in the future have become more serious and significant .
When we took over the government three years ago , the previous ruling party had waded through six amendments to the Constitution in the 1990s .
From handling the total re-election of the parliament in 1991 , holding the direct presidential election in 1994 , freezing the provincial government functions in 1997 to abolishing the permanent status of the National Assembly in 2000 , this series of difficult process of amending the Constitution , is in fact the path the Taiwanese people have followed in strengthening their sovereignty and justification of democratization .
If we regard the direct presidential election by popular vote in 1996 as the most important symbol of Taiwan as an independent and sovereign nation , then by 2006 this " complete " nation will have reached the age of 10 .
After a decade of practice , we must ponder over this question : As an independent , sovereign and democratic nation , what should we pursue next ?
I must say that in the next stage we should further pursue the deepening of democratization and a more efficient constitutional government system so as to be able to lead the Taiwanese people in meeting the harsh challenges of the new century .
As the largest continent in the world with an area constituting nearly 30 % of the land on Earth , a current population of about 60 % of the world total and a total economic output making up a quarter of the world total , Asia should and can make outstanding contribution to the world 's peace and development .
Asia boasts time-honored and brilliant cultures . The Yellow River , the Yangtze River valley , the Indus and the Ganges , the Euphrates and the Tigris basin are all famous cradles of human civilization .
In the long course of history , the Asian peoples have made remarkable contributions to the development of human civilization .
Since the modern period , Asia has undergone great changes and suffered numerous hardships . In order to win liberation and seek development , people in all Asian countries have made untiring efforts and achieved tremendous accomplishments .
However , it is still a long way to go before Asia can rise anew and rejuvenate .
Strengthening cooperation , promoting development and creating win-win situations are the only ways through which Asia can rise anew and rejuvenate . It is also where the fundamental interest of Asian people lies .
In the new situation of the millennium , the development of Asia is facing new opportunities .
Peace and development are still the main topics in today 's time . An overall peaceful international environment has provided favorable external conditions for the development of Asia .
Economic globalization is deepening ; worldwide revolutions in science and technology are making progress by leaps and bounds ; and optimization and reorganization of international manufacturing resources and industrial outsourcing are accelerating . All these provide Asian countries opportunities to utilize international funds , import advanced technologies , open up global markets and boost domestic economic growth .
With its rich resources and vast market , Asia is the most economically viable region in the world and promises tremendous potential for development .
Large population and underdevelopment are two major national conditions of China .
Since China has a population of 1.3 billion , no matter how tiny a problem is , it becomes a huge one once it is multiplied by 1.3 billion ; no matter how abundant financial and material resources are , they shrink to exceptionally minuscule average per capita once they are divided by 1.3 billion .
This is what Chinese leaders must keep firmly in their mind at any time .
To solve the problem of 1.3 billion people , we can only rely on ourselves and nobody else .
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , we have made great achievements in our development , yet at the same time we have taken some detours and missed a few opportunities .
After we started the reform and opening up in 1978 , we finally found a right way for our own development .
That is : Chinese people build socialism with Chinese characteristics independently and autonomously .
Its essence is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop productive forces , and respect and ensure Chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness .
China 's reform and opening up extended from rural areas to cities and from the economical area to political , cultural and social areas .
Each time it goes further , its objective , after all , is always to emancipate the competitive power of all labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital , and allow a complete utilization of all resources capable of creating social wealth .
In recent years , the world has been undergoing profound changes . Science and technology are making progress with each passing day ; the global productivity keeps going up ; and the markets in the world are in closer contact with one another , opening up historic opportunities for the development of all nations .
However , it is noteworthy that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemics , environmental deterioration and other issues are still threatening the stability and development in the world .
The negative impact of economic globalization has increased the risk and cost of economic and social development in the developing countries , some of whom are even at risk of being marginalized .
At present , we are still facing many uncertainties in spite of a gradual recovery of the global economy .
The stalled Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations , trade protectionism and other complicated issues have increased the hardship for the developing countries .
Fortunately , a great many developing countries have made remarkable achievements in making progress , implementing reforms and building a prosperous homeland .
On the international arena , developing countries , relying on organizations such as Non-Alliance Movement and G-77 , have strengthened their solidarity and cooperation and made significant contributions in safeguarding their own legitimate rights and changing the unjust international political and economical order . They have become an important force in democratizing the international relations .
In the meantime , great achievements have also been made in exchanges and cooperation among developing countries and their economic contacts have become more and more frequent .
From the Andes to the Mekong , from the establishment of Arab Maghreb Union to the Africa Union , South-South cooperation has been continuously enriched , improved and updated both in content and form and in mechanism and strategy .
Last year also saw the continuing all-round development of the friendly cooperation between China and Canada .
The trade between the two countries kept its growth with a total volume of trade reaching nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars .
High-level contacts were frequent . A group of top Canadian officials such as the foreign minister , defense minister , environmental minister and minister for international cooperation , visited China one by one , while China 's Supreme Court president , minister of commerce and other high-level officials also visited Canada . More importantly , the reciprocal visits by the prime ministers of the two countries materialized .
Premier Wen Jiabao 's recent visit to Canada is an important milestone in the history of the two nations . It instilled new vitalities for the further development of the relations between China and Canada and laid a solid foundation for the friendly cooperation in various fields between the two countries to further develop both in scope and depth .
China and Canada will continue to strengthen their cooperation in politics , economics , culture and education , and science and technology among others and they will strive to double the total bilateral trade volume by 2010 .
My fellow overseas countrymen and friends ,
Although you now live overseas , your hearts are always with your hometown . You are very much concerned with the development and progress of your motherland . At each and every crucial juncture , you always share both worries and happiness with the people in your motherland . Your lives are linked with that of your motherland .
Last year , after some areas in China were hit by SARS and floods , you showed your deep concern and good wishes to the people in your motherland via the Internet , letters , telephone and donations , etc . Overseas Chinese from all walks of life also held a series of large-scale fundraising events and benefit performances . When Shenzhou 5 successfully completed its manned space flight , your telephone calls , letters and cards of congratulation poured in ; everyone was excited and proud about the achievement made by China in space science and technology .
During Premier Wen Jiabao 's visit to Canada , hundreds of overseas Chinese and students braved the winter storm to come to the airport and Parliament Hill to welcome Premier Wen Jiabao . There were many heart-touching scenes .
Now I 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heart-felt gratitude to all of you . I am sure you will continue to make new and greater contributions in this new year to the prosperity of China , the development of China-Canada relations , and the complete reunification and rejuvenation of China .
First , to strengthen mutual political trust and deepen strategic cooperation .
As permanent member states of the UN Security Council , both China and France have a significant influence on the international affairs .
Both of our countries are in favor of promoting multi-polarization of the world . We advocate the safeguarding of the UN authority and are willing to help establish a new international political and economic order that meets the wishes of people in all countries .
Both of our countries have extensive consensus and common interests in meeting various challenges facing humanity , and in properly handling major international issues and others .
We are willing to increase our dialogue and consultation with France on major issues such as fighting terrorism , preventing proliferation , cracking down on transnational crimes , promoting common development and strengthening the role of the UN ; and to have close cooperation and to be committed to safeguarding the world peace and promoting common development .
Second , to strengthen economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutual benefits and complementarity .
As the largest developing country in the world , China is going full steam ahead with its modernization and has a vast market .
France , as a developed country and world leader in economy , science and technology , has cutting-edge technologies in many fields .
The strong complementarity between our two economies promises a great potential for economic and trade cooperation .
Since the founding of New China , the Chinese government has always placed a great emphasis on developing relations with Africa and has formulated a series of guidelines and policies in this respect .
We always adhere to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and respect African countries ' independence and autonomy in their choice of political system and way of development . We provide African countries assistance within our capabilities and carry out economic and technological cooperation . We support the solidarity and cooperation among African countries and their alliance for self empowerment . We urge the international community to pay attention to the peace and development in Africa and support the equal participation of African countries in international affairs . We reinforce the consultation and cooperation between China and Africa and jointly safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries .
The friendship between China and Africa dates back to ancient times and reaches deep into people 's hearts .
Since the founding of New China , we have always firmly supported the national liberation cause of Africa and provided sincere assistance to the development of national economy in various African countries .
Chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers dispatched to Africa work shoulder by shoulder with the people there and get along well with them like real brothers and sisters .
In international affairs , China and African countries understand and support each other and become partners who trust each other .
The Chinese people will never forget that at the 26th UN Assembly in 1971 , it was with the strong support from most developing countries , including various African countries , that China smoothly restored its legitimate seat in the United Nations .
In recent years , officials at various levels and in various fields in China and Africa have built increasingly deeper mutual political trust . Achievements have been made in economic cooperation and trade . The friendly exchanges in culture and education , health , science and technology , sports and other fields are thriving . The China-Africa Cooperation Forum established at the beginning of this century has provided a new platform for the development of China-Africa relations and the deepening of cooperation .
As both China and Africa have decided to establish a new type of long-term , stable partnership based on equality and mutual benefit , the friendly cooperation between China and Africa has entered a new phase of an all-round development .
Seven years after Nixon visited China and Sino-U.S. Shanghai Communique was announced , the Carter administration accepted China 's position on the Taiwan issue and established diplomatic relations between China and the United States .
This event and Deng Xiaoping 's successful visit to the United States opened a new page in the Sino-American relations .
In the early Reagan administration , China and the United States had fierce clashes on the Taiwan issue .
After painstaking negotiations , the two governments announced the famous August 17 Communique in 1982 and reached an agreement on the step-by-step resolution of the arms sales to Taiwan .
Shanghai Communique , the Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the United States , and the August 17 Communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for the Sino-U.S. relations .
During the ten years after the establishment of diplomatic relations , although the two countries fought over the Taiwan issue and others from time to time , the overall Sino-U.S. relations were stable with increasing contact and cooperation in all aspects .
In the 1980s and early 1990s , East Europe underwent dramatic transformation . With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and ending of the Cold War , the international situation had experienced the most profound change since World War II .
The United States took the lead in imposing sanctions against China by announcing the sales of 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan and linking the issue of human rights with the status of the most favorable nation . Its permission of Lee Tung-hui to visit the United States brought the Sino-U.S. relations to its lowest level .
With the rapid economic development in China , China 's international status is continuously on the rise .
More and more people in the United States have come to realize that it is in the interest of both China and the United States to improve and develop the Sino-U.S. relations .
Six months ago , it was also in this hall that we successfully initiated the process of the six-nation talks and set firmly the direction of resolving the nuclear issue peacefully .
In the past half year , all parties held constant talks and negotiations , making ample and indepth preparations for the new round of talks while getting to understand more each other 's position .
Now , all parties hope that the second round of talks will address the substantive issues and yield concrete results . All agree to resolve the mutual concerns through coordinated steps ; and all hope to keep the peace process started by the six-nation talks .
These form the important basis for our talks today .
The significance of the second round of talks lies in initiating the discussion of the substantive issues , which shows the process of peace talks takes another new step forward .
This round of talks will cover how to set the concrete goal of resolving the nuclear issue , exploring the first-phase measures of resolving the nuclear issue and studying ways to maintain the process of talks .
As the talks progress further , we will also meet more difficulties and face more challenges , but this is exactly the responsibility history has given us and the hope the international community has placed on us .
Here gather we six parties , representative of the strong political wish of seeking peace for the six nations and their peoples .
The objective of our talks is to expand consensus not to highlight disagreements , to solve problems not to intensify conflicts .
China believes each party , being aware of the peace mission on its shoulders , will take a constructive approach and in the spirit of cooperation and understanding will show mutual respect , demonstrate flexibility and narrow discrepancies .
The second round of six-nation talks in Beijing completed the scheduled agenda after more than three days of negotiatons .
I am thankful to all the governments , all the delegation leaders and staff for their contributions .
If we say the first round of talks set the grand goal of a nuclear-free peninsula , then the significance of this round of talks lies in conducting substantive dialogues and taking a big new step toward realizing the grand goal .
During the talks , all parties conducted indepth and constructive discussions , explored ways and steps of solving the problems with wisdom and rationality , proposed valuable suggestions and made active declaration of policies .
A series of beneficial results have been achieved at the talks . In particular , consensus has been reached on such issues as the next round of talks and the formation of a working group , which are of great importance for pushing forward the process of the peace talks .
Dear colleagues , peace and development are the topics of our great time .
The peoples of the six nations , on whose behalf you are here , need peace , long for peace and love peace . Peoples of all nations in the world need peace , long for peace and love peace .
In these three days , the international community has been watching Beijing and Diaoyutai , placing great hopes in this round of talks .
Some people may think the talks did not yield enough results and the process did not move fast enough .
My opinion is : This round of talks was started when the relevant parties lacked mutual trust and their differences in positions were widening .
The Chinese government has consistently adhered to the basic principle of " peaceful reunification and one country under two systems " on the issue of Taiwan .
For this goal , we have tried our best , demonstrated our utmost sincerity and done a great deal of work .
However , our efforts are challenged by Taiwan authorities and the forces of " Taiwan 's independence . "
We respect the desire of the Taiwanese people for democracy , but we oppose the attempts by Taiwan authorities and " separatist " forces to pursue Taiwan 's independence and cut off Taiwan from its motherland in the name of democracy .
The reason why we clearly demonstrate our determination and will to preserve the unity of our motherland is that we want to safeguard the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait .
As we have expressed , as long as there is a slim chance of hope , we will work to our utmost to bring about the peaceful reunification of our motherland .
We appreciate President Bush 's reiteration of one-China position , which sent a clear signal to the " Taiwan 's independence " forces .
Taiwan authorities claim : " In order to prevent China from invading Taiwan by force and unilaterally changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait , we must push for the March 20 peace referendum . "
This is a vilification of the Mainland 's peace efforts as well as a provocation of the cross-Strait relations .
At present , the real threat to Taiwan 's security does not come from the Mainland but from the unbridled " Taiwan 's independence " separatist activities staged by Taiwan authorities .
It is none other than the separatist forces that are the direct cause of undermining the status quo in the cross-Strait relations and jeopardizing the peace in the Taiwan Strait .
Taiwan authorities distort the Chinese mainland 's opposition to " Taiwan 's independence " and its preservation of the stability across the Taiwan Strait as attempts to attack and crush the democracy and freedom in Taiwan and use them as an excuse to launch the referendum .
This is a groudless accusation turning the truth upside down and aiming to fraudulently gain sympathy and support for their continuous promotion of separatism .
Taiwan authorities claim the upcoming referendum as so called " defensive referendum " and " peace referendum . " Yet however packaged , this act of provocation will only increase the cross-Strait hostility and hatred , intensifying the cross-Strait tension and pushing the cross-Strait relations step by step to the brink of danger .
This completely runs counter to Taiwan compatriots ' mainstream aspiration for peace , stability and development . Instead of deepening " democratization " in Taiwan , it misleads and manipulates the Taiwan people . It is also a serious threat to peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region and will surely meet with universal opposition by people across the Strait and by the international community .
A general review of the historic process of the development of the Chinese nation shows that the unification has always been the mainstream . It is where the dominant trend leads and where the heart belongs .
As the motherland grows increasingly stronger and the cross-Strait cooperation continues to deepen , the one-China status generally recognized by the international community will stand more solidified and any attempt at splittism is doomed to failure .
There are a little over two weeks left before the Lunar New Year , which is one of the most observed traditional holidays for Chinese .
On this jolly occasion , we are accustomed to getting together with close relatives and good friends and exchanging gifts to show our hearts .
HongKong Post , in its motto of " Linking People , Delivering Business , " is promoting this " Hong Kong / Mainland Gift Fulfilment Service " in collaboration with China Post to deliver Hong Kong people 's regards and best wishes to their relatives and customers living in the Mainland or in Hong Kong during the Spring Festival .
Hongkong Post has always been committed to collaboration with its counterparts to provide International Fulfilment service .
As early as December 2002 , it launched Foreign Wine Fulfilment service jointly with its Australian counterpart to provide Hong Kong residents quality products .
This time we collaborate with China Post and further expand our close cooperation long established in the fields of postal affairs , postal remittance , express delivery into cross-border fulfilment service . It is to meet the increasing market demand of Hong Kong residents for sending gifts to their relatives or customers in the Mainland that we launch this " Hong Kong / Mainland Gift Fulfilment Service . "
The first batch of gifts includes New Year 's gift boxes , which come in different varieties and are exquisitely packaged . Inside the boxes are holiday candies , tea leaves and dried seafood featuring a great selection to choose from , depending on budget .
They are all ideal gifts either for relatives or friends in the Mainland or for business partners .
For three decades , the contribution made by the Consumer Council to protecting the rights and interests of consumers is evident to all .
There has been no better way to assess the performance of the Consumer Council than finding out if the rights and interests of consumers have been substantially improved .
I strongly agree with what Chairman Chen just said . After thirty years , not only consumers have become clearly aware of their own rights and interests , but also their rights and interests are valued by all sectors of society . This is the result of hard work by both the Consumer Council and the government .
The Consumer Council tests products periodically , conducts market surveys on various products and services , and studies industrial operations . Through its monthly " Choice , " it releases fair and objective market information to the public .
The monthly " Choice " has won the trust of citizens . Now that the monthly " Choice " is developing its online version , it will play its role more efficiently in assisting consumers to access market information more conveniently and quickly .
The Consumer Council has 11 regional consumer consultation centers and 16 hotlines to provide consumers information concerning products and services and take consumers ' complaints .
Since the establishment of the Consumer Council , the number of inquiries it receives has continued to grow , from about a few thousands at the beginning of its establishment in the 1970s up to 146,000 inquiries last year . The increase rate of over 20 times shows more and more consumers consult the Consumer Council 's reports and opinions before choosing products and services .
In addition , the Consumer Council processed more than 26,000 complaints this year .
The Consumer Council also red flags a few individual stores that are unethically run , which not only helps consumers guard against fraud but also serves as deterrent to store managers .
Legislator Yang , on July 1 , I told you I watched TV closely and I later did quite a lot of self examination . I noticed citizens had many complaints and grudges , and were dissatisfied with the performance of the government .
In this respect , the government and I both tried very hard to make improvement during the past six or seven months . When we saw that citizens demanded for improvement of economy and life , we also worked very hard toward that . When we knew that citizens had many complaints about Article 23 of the " Basic Law , " we took Article 23 out . The government indeed responded immediately .
As for the social appeal for democracy , I also understand it clearly .
However , Legislator Yang , I want to tell you that what I am doing today is exactly to ensure that everything can be done smoothly once the review of the constitutional development starts . Therefore , some basic problems must be solved first . These are totally two different things .
What are the basic problems ?
Some are problems of principle , while others are problems concerning law , involving the interpretation of some articles about the review of constitutional development in the " Basic Law . " We must do some work on this first .
We are now working on this part . A three-person task force has already started to do this work .
It will consult the Central Government and will also take soundings in Hong Kong . I think this is a very good step . It is a decision we made because we value the public opinion in Hong Kong .
In today 's highly competitive commercial environment , the brand name plays a crucial role in the success of a product .
To create a brand name takes more than a single day . It requires a creative design , premium quality , thoughtful packaging , effective marketing and sustained investment .
Hong Kong has the making of a brand name .
We have relevant knowledge , skills and experience , and a galaxy of talent from designing , manufacturing , marketing to management . In addition we have a vast market .
The CEPA which just went into effect will add to our advantages . In addition to its preferential treatment of zero tariffs for accessing the mainland market , the best of CEPA lies in motivating businesspeople to find ways to increase the added value of their products so that they become popular brand names in Hong Kong , the Mainland and even in the world .
The voting of " Hong Kong Top Ten Brand Names " by the Chinese Manufacturers ' Association of Hong Kong happens to be based on the same idea as the CEPA 's promotion of developing value-added Hong Kong products .
Over five years , this voting has created 51 " Hong Kong Top Ten Brand Names . "
However , in the vast market of the Mainland , 51 brand names amount to almost nothing . We need " Hong Kong Top Brand Names " by the hundred , the thousand , and even more .
For years , Hong Kong 's MTRC has been participating in the subway projects in the major cities of mainland China , bringing its rich experience in Hong Kong to the mainland market by means of service .
I am very pleased that Hong Kong 's investment , professional services and the quality of management personnel have been recognized in the mainland market .
Such exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong not only help the development of the motherland but also provide Hong Kong businesspeople more opportunities for development . They do more than boost economy as they also provide more job opportunities for Hong Kong .
It is with the help of supportive policies of the Central Government , the government of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and many others that we have reached an agreement in principle on this project . I hereby extend my great thanks .
For the first time , the MTRC has gone beyond Hong Kong to participate in the development of the mainland subways through investments and bring even more Hong Kong brand names to the Mainland . This is indeed something that people in Hong Kong and Mainland should feel happy about .
I hereby wish for an early official approval from the Central Government for Line 4 of Shenzhen Metro System and for a smooth construction of the project so that a stronger foundation will be laid for more exchange and cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the future .
Today is January 5 of the Lunar New Year . I am very happy to be invited by the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society to attend your group exchange of New Year greetings and to host the opening ceremony of the gold market for the new year .
First of all , let me extend my greeting to each of you and wish you all be energetic , lucky , prosperous , and successful in the Year of the Monkey .
In the past year the price of gold rose dramatically . Recently it even exceeded the level of 400 U.S. dollar per ounce . The sustained strong rise reflects investors ' renewed confidence in gold .
I believe my colleagues must have also had a good business last year .
In fact , the thriving market owes as much to the external factors as to the successful management of the Gold & Silver Exchange Society for more than 90 years of hard work .
The hard work has not only laid a solid foundation for the gold market in Hong Kong but also contributed even more to the consolidation of Hong Kong 's position as an international financial center .
As the old saying goes that " make your plan for the year in spring , " I hope all my colleagues at the Gold & Silver Exchange Society will continue to work hard in the coming year , seize the " golden " time of the gold and silver industry , take hold of the demand for gold trade brought about by the gold market reform in the Mainland , China 's accession to the WTO and CEPA , and further promote the market development .
I believe that with my colleagues ' active promotion , the gold market in Hong Kong will surely have brilliant performance in the coming year .
Finally , let me wish for a very prosperous Year of the Monkey for the gold market , all industries and businesses .
Thank you very much .
However , the challenges in the past were not limited to government-funded public housing . Private housing was also greatly challenged .
The financial crisis in 1997 led to the burst of assets bubble . As a result , real estate prices plunged by 70 % , hitting property owners really hard . This was also the main reason that deflation was aggravated several times over the past five years .
Now that economy is turning around , we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure the real estate market will continue its steady growth .
A healthy real estate market is indeed of crucial importance to the continuous recovery of Hong Kong 's economy .
We are also devoted to protecting and improving our living environment .
Our future efforts should be based on the principle of sustainable development . We will improve our living environment through more proper urban design and better protection of natural and cultural heritage in Hong Kong .
We will double our attention to the issue of overall environment .
The lesson we learned from the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong last year reminds us that we must make every effort to create a more spacious , cleaner and healthier living environment .
We will provide better landscaping and more greenery ; and add parks and leisure and recreational facilities for the benefit of the community .
Many council members have expressed their opinions on the sections concerning legislature and law , political system , civil servants and government-funded public service employees , and security in the Chief Executive 's " Policy Address , " and I hereby extend my appreciation to them .
Only Councilwoman Margaret Ng and Councilman Tsang Yok-sing have spoken about the subjects of the judicial and legal services . They are chair and vice chair of Judicial and Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council .
The Chief Executive put forward many measures to promote people-based governance such as increasing contact of key officials with the public , conducting more studies on public policy , strengthening the cooperation between the government and the Legislative Council and carrying out serious reviews of the constitutional development .
Department of Justice will fully participate in the aforementioned work and ensure all government measures comply with laws and procedures and in particular with the " Basic Law , " including the basic civil rights and freedom it protects . In the meantime , the department will keep vigilance as Councilwoman Ng said to safeguard the independence of the rule of law and the judiciary in Hong Kong .
As a chief officer , I will certainly try my best to understand the opinions of the general public and the legal community on the issues that affect judicial affairs and legal profession .
For example , CEPA is a product of the close cooperation among the government and the business community , including Hong Kong Bar Association , the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Association of China Appointed Attesting Officers Ltd .
We have successfully included " legal services " in the CEPA and made it one of the service industries opened by the Mainland . This has provided a new platform for stepping up the cooperation in legal services between the two sides and will bring macro and long-term benefits to the legal services on both sides .
The work of the task force is bidirectional . We will report to the Central Government about what we did taking soundings in Hong Kong .
From mid-January of this year up till now , we have interviewed about a dozen of groups and individuals .
All of them fully accept that the constitutional development in Hong Kong needs to comply with " one country , two systems , " and that Hong Kong SAR is under the direct jurisdiction of the Central Government .
Most of them believe that the constitutional system of Hong Kong needs improvement ; yet at the same time they also accept that any development must be within the framework of the " Basic Law . "
The groups and individuals also have their own opinions on a few procedural and legal issues .
The task force will fully convey these wishes , views and statements of opinion of theirs to the Central Government .
In the coming month or so , the task force will continue to interview other groups and individuals and we will forward the opinions we receive successively to the Central Government .
Today 's meeting is only the first one the task force has with the relevant agency of the Central Government ; and we will still need to continue our follow-up and exchange of views with the Central Government .
I believe everybody understands that the development of the constitutional system involves the relations between the Central Government and the SAR ; that the Central Government also has the constitutional right and responsibility to review the constitutional development in the SAR and that we need to fully consult with the Central Government .
West Kowloon Cultural District is a large-scale cultural and arts project Hong Kong has never undertaken before . It is not only a project that provides our residents with a space for cultural and art pursuits , recreation and entertainment , but also a project to raise the qualities of the urban life and its residents .
The construction of West Kowloon Cultural District entails the participation of the entire Hong Kong community .
The government must continue working with people from all walks of life for exploration in more depth and collect wisdom from a wide range of sources .
We understand that we cannot pursue esthetic beauty of the architecture alone . We must also make the project capable of generating economical benefits , sustaining development and raising the quality of life of urban residents .
Therefore , the government attaches great importance to support services for West Kowloon Cultural District . They must work in conjunction with relevant measures , including the management policies on the facilities , promotion tactics for the cultural programs , contents of performances and exhibitions , advertising tactics , etc .
The formulation of these relevant tactics must be carefully based on the opinions of the " users . "
The young generation , including every young friend present here , will be one of the major types of users of West Kowloon Cultural District in the future .
It is our hope that people , young and old , with refined or popular taste , can all enjoy this district . It will be such a place of attraction that both Hong Kong residents and tourists from other places , mature adults or lively youth , will love to stay forever .
I know you held a discussion on several different aspects of West Kowloon Cultural District this morning . Some students even spent a lot of time and energy in the past month or so preparing the special reports . I am sure you are already very familiar with the details of the project .
I just could not wait to hear the result of your discussion and hope I can exchange opinions with you .
Since the Sept . 11 terrorist attacks , the global attention has focused on the security at seaports , airports and borders .
As the port of origin in the world that ships the largest number of containers to the United States , Hong Kong undoubtedly responded promptly to the " Container Security Initiative " put forward by the United States .
In addition , we believe that cutting off the life line of terrorist groups can also be an effective measure to stop terrorist activities .
Every day , large sums of funds flowing in and out of the global financial system have always puzzled the law enforcement agencies that target criminal profit-making and money laundering .
As a key financial center in Asia , we believe cutting off funds of terrorists may be the most effective way to destroy their network from its very foundation .
At present , Hong Kong 's legislative body is discussing various proposals for improvement so as to tighten the existing laws and regulations that aim at cracking down on terrorist funding . It is also amending laws and regulations in active compliance with the international standards and situation such as the new proposal by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering .
Besides , we are also trying to draw up a better information disclosure law to make it easier for agencies and individuals to report suspicious transactions .
" Balance " is also the key in this job : Valid investigation right , freedom and personal privacy protected by the constitution , and efficiency of economic and financial systems are all factors that must be considered .
Our regulatory measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , fairness and efficiency .
In fact , the service sector in Hong Kong has advantages in many aspects .
Professionals and commercial service personnel in Hong Kong have a deep understanding of the business operations both in mainland China and the rest of the world .
Professional services in Hong Kong like accounting , finance , law , arbitration , etc. are the best partners for the mainland businesses in their globalization and getting in line with the world market .
Our transport , construction , designing and market promotion , management consulting , information science and technology , conventions and exhibitions and other services , on the other hand , can help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of the mainland enterprises and assist them in developing strategies for market promotion of products and improving brand images .
Services like tourism , healthcare and insurance can all the more assist in the development of the related markets and industries in the Mainland and improve their quality of service .
The close cooperation between service industries in Hong Kong and the Mainland will greatly enhance the existing advantages each has now and help both in taking the opportunities and challenges brought about by the economic globalization .
In order to promote the development of professional service industries in the mainland market , Secretary for Finance and I , together with officials from the Policy Bureaux and Administration Division and several representatives from different professional industries , just had substantive and valuable discussions in Beijing last week on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other topics of interest to the business community with the relevant departments and counterpart industries in the Mainland .
I am very pleased that we have taken the first important step toward the business development of the mainland market by signing the agreements on mutual recognition of qualifications and cooperation in the three professional industries of construction , structural engineering and insurance .
Through this meeting , the professional industries in Hong Kong have also established closer relations with the regulatory agencies in the Mainland and laid a good foundation for the friendly cooperation in the next stage .
I believe the great majority of Hong Kong citizens love the motherland and love Hong Kong .
In fact , either before or after its return to China , Hong Kong has always had very close and interdependent economic , social , political and cultural ties with the Mainland .
In the economic field , Hong Kong industry has had a chance to move north and gained new space for development since our country instituted the four modernization programs , implemented reforms and the opening up more than two decades ago . This , as we can see , has brought Hong Kong community into closer touch with the Mainland .
Recently , we have another chance to make an arrangement with the Central Government for closer economic and trade relations so that various service sectors in Hong Kong can have new opportunities to participate more actively and more extensively in the economic development in the Mainland and to make a new round of contributions to our country and Hong Kong . This will also bring Hong Kong and the Mainland closer together .
In social development , we see the country has been making phenomenal progress in recent years .
Hong Kong citizens were very excited when they saw Beijing successful bid for hosting the 2008 Olympic Games .
A few months earlier , they were equally excited when Yang Weili paid a visit to Hong Kong . Why is so ?
Because we think everybody , every Hong Kong citizen should feel proud for such achievement made by our country .
I know that Legislative Council started to discuss with the government about the site of the permanent office of Legislative Council as early as ten years ago .
Likewise , the government has also been pondering over the long-term plan of relocating the government headquarters for more than a decade .
Therefore , I understand the government 's decision to postpone the Tamar Project which includes the new Legislative Council Complex will certainly disappoint some of the legislators .
I know that the legislators will have to suffer some inconvenience by continuing to work in a less than satisfactory place for this period of time .
However , just as I said to my colleagues in the government who are also affected by this decision , I hope everybody can give priority to public interests , understand the factors involved and exercise more patience during this period .
Earlier I explained many times to the Legislative Council Commission that after considering the current fiscal situation and the financial status in the wake of the SARS outbreak last year , the government does not consider it an appropriate time now to proceed with the Tamar Project or any large-scale office building project .
Postponing the project of the new Legislative Council Complex at Tamar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government in the coming years . It is in the public interests and is also accepted by the public .
The government will resume the project of developing the new Legislative Council Complex at Tamar as soon as public finances improve . Our current plan will do so .
Our country cares very much about Hong Kong . So do the chairman and the premier . I know they and the Central Government will make every effort to do a good job in this area .
So , good news will come in succession from tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , freedom traffic rights , zero-tariff on products and service industry .
I also sincerely hope that with its economic recovery , Hong Kong can capitalize more on its advantages to make greater contribution to the development of our country .
When I met Premier Wen Jiabao , I , on behalf of Hong Kong , also congratulated him on the admirable achievement our country made under his leadership during the past difficult year . Although many challenges lie ahead , he is full of confidence as you have all heard from his work report . We are all very much encouraged by that .
Premier Wen also told me that reviewing Mr. Deng Xiaoping 's important remarks on " one country , two systems " 20 years ago is of great significance for us to have a complete and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems , " which will be very helpful for the constitutional development in the future .
He also told me that people of Hong Kong should really seize this opportunity to focus on economic development and improvement on living standards . He is full of confidence in Hong Kong .
Later I will meet with Mr. Zhang Dejiang , secretary of Guangdong Provincial Party Committee , and Governor Huang Huahua , to discuss with them how to push our cooperation to a higher level and create a bigger win-win situation based on our current achievements .
The last point is the notion of " Hong Kong governed by the people of Hong Kong " that everybody has become familiar with recently . This system requires that Hong Kong be governed by the people of Hong Kong , the majority of whom are patriots .
There are also clear-cut standards for being patriots . They should be those people of Hong Kong who respect their own nation , sincerely support the restoration of our country 's sovereignty over Hong Kong and refrain from doing anything detrimental to our country and Hong Kong . It is these patriots that make the majority of the government who should govern Hong Kong .
I must reiterate that the people of Hong Kong as a whole are patriotic .
What is referred to here is not the ordinary Hong Kong citizens but those individuals who participate in the management of public affairs in Hong Kong and hold key positions in the administrative body , the Legislative Council and the judicial branch .
When they are sworn into office , they must show their support for the " Basic Law " of Hong Kong SAR of the People 's Republic of China in accordance with the " Basic Law " and pledge their allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People 's Republic of China .
The above five or six principles and their serious considerations I have talked about are actually the set of long-term guidelines and policies that had been set forth as early as in the 1980s when people started to talk about the distant future of Hong Kong , worked on " the Joint Declaration " and finalized the " Basic Law . " It has so far remained unchanged and will never be changed . Since it is a series of long-term guidelines and policies governing our country restoration of sovereignty over Hong Kong and it is our state policy , it will never be changed .
Several hundred years after its establishment , especially since the Industrial Revolution , the system of intellectual property has brought forth a succession of major inventions of epoch-breaking significance .
In the recent two decades , the system of intellectual property has become the basic legal system and important policy and measure for various countries in promoting technological innovation and has played a key role in boosting their economy and enhancing their international competitiveness .
At present , with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization , the quantity and quality of intellectual property ownership as well as the creation , possession and application of knowledge and intellectual resources have become the important foundation for all countries in participating in the international competitions .
Therefore , stepping up the international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection is of great importance to the establishment of a just and reasonable new international economic order , and to the promotion of the global economic prosperity and development .
The Chinese government lays great emphasis on intellectual property protection .
Our country started to establish the system of intellectual property in the early stage of our reform and opening up . After more than two decades of hard work , we have developed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property and established a system of intellectual property protection which combines both judicial and executive branches . We have done a great deal of work in the area of intellectual property protection and made an important contribution to the progress of science and technology and economic and social development .
As the world entered the information age in the 21st century , science and technology will promote the development of man productivity with unprecedented force .
For our country to expand opening up to the outside world in the new century , it is necessary to further improve our system of intellectual property and strengthen international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection . It is also necessary for the construction of a modern socialist country and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
We are willing to work together with various countries in the world to establish a system of intellectual property , which is just , reasonable and conducive to the promotion of science and technology and economic development in all countries , and to create a good environment in which all the people respect knowledge , advocate science and protect intellectual property .
The most important task for Shanghai Cooperation Organization now is to speed up the institutionalization of the organization .
Thanks to efforts by all parties , great progress has been made in the preparation for the set-up of the secretariat and a regional anti-terrorism agency .
We will redouble our efforts to ensure that the secretariat start its official operation within this year and the regional anti-terrorism agency be set up as soon as possible .
To show that it takes SCO seriously , the Chinese government , as a hosting nation for organizing the secretariat , has decided to provide the secretariat free offices .
In the future , we will also continue to provide strong support for the smooth operation of the secretariat .
It has always been the SCO 's focus of work to deepen and promote security cooperation .
We will be always on guard against the " Three Forces " that have done serious harm to the interests of all member countries in the region and will never allow them to have their way .
We should make unrelenting efforts on a long-term basis to eradicate these evil forces so as to effectively safeguard the security and stability in the region .
In order to cut off the financial sources for the activities of the " Three Forces " and combat these " Three Forces " more completely and effectively , we should put the issue of fighting drug trafficking on the agenda of the security cooperation as soon as possible .
Economic cooperation is the important foundation and prioritized direction for the SCO .
Education is the cornerstone of the modern civilization .
To enhance the overall quality of the people in our country and increase total national capabilities , education must be vigorously promoted .
Rural education has a wide range of impact and affects the overall rural economy and social development .
Since the reform and opening up , tremendous and profound changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas in our country . This owes a great deal to the education , especially the rural education .
The implementation in rural areas of the family contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated the productive forces .
One of the underlying reasons why advanced and practical farming technologies can be extensively applied , why rural enterprises can suddenly emerge as a new force , and why the surplus labor in rural areas can have a massive migration to the coastal areas and towns and cities is that they are all backed by a rural labor force of hundreds of millions of people who have received obligatory education . Credit should be given to universal obligatory education in rural areas .
At present , the agriculture and rural economy in our country are in a crucial stage of development . The development of high quality , high efficient , ecologically-friendly and safe agriculture , the expansion of industrialized agriculture and the relocation of rural surplus labor force all make it an urgent need to fully raise the overall qualification of rural labor force .
The emergence in the world of a revolution in new science and technology and the progress made in building an overall well-to-do society have raised higher demands for the scientific , cultural , ideological and moral qualifications of the vast majority of rural population .
Without the implementation of universal compulsory 9th grade education in rural areas and comprehensive enhancement of qualification of peasants , it would be very hard to realize an overall well-to-do society .
We must fully recognize that rural education constitutes a fundamental , precursory and integral part of our efforts to building an overall well-to-do society .
Among the advisors and distinguished guests who attend this conference are famous top leaders of multinational corporations , world renowned economists and accomplished experts and scholars .
I am deeply touched by the sincere cooperation and the active and pragmatic approach demonstrated by all the advisors .
Bringing our cooperation and collective wisdom into full play not only helps in planning and promoting the development of Guangdong but also helps our concerted efforts in promoting cooperation and development in all fields .
I had been looking forward to the 2003 International Consultation Conference on Economic Development of Guangdong so that I can listen to and learn about your valuable advice on the economic and social development of Guangdong .
We are happily gathering here today to pursue one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchange , seek more space for development , infuse new vitalities into the economic and social development of Guangdong and create opportunities for the development of your businesses .
China 's accession to the WTO marks a brand new phase of the opening up to the outside world as we are participating in the international competition in broader areas , more extensive fields and at higher levels .
As a province with the highest degree of overseas-oriented economy in the Mainland , Guangdong has been the first to experience the unprecedented opportunities for development and to meet the accompanying harsh challenges .
Against such a backdrop , we must seize new opportunities and meet new challenges , enhance our international competitiveness in all aspects and actively proceed with the modernization programs . We must strive to open up new prospects for economic cooperation so as to achieve common development through long-term , mutually complementary and beneficial cooperation .
The people of Guangdong are focused on building an overall well-to-do society and accelerating their efforts for modernization , which will create more opportunities and room for development for all our friends .
The economy of Guangdong , thriving with vitality and broad prospects , is rising vigorously to new heights .
Recently , Iraq 's interim Governing Council and the U.S. occupying authorities signed an agreement in Baghdad , announcing a timetable for a step-by-step transfer of power to hand over the government back to Iraq by June next year .
This agreement was reluctantly approved by the international community : Although the meeting of the EU foreign ministers welcomed the move , France considered " the process too slow ; " while Annan , the UN secretary general , felt encouraged about this plan of power transfer , he said " it still premature " for the United Nations to play its role in Iraq ; Russia , on the other hand , flatly contested the legitimacy of the agreement .
The Iraqis gave a cold response ; public opinions in the United States even consider it " a big gamble . "
In short , most people are still somewhat skeptical and choose to wait and see .
It is not without reason that the international community has so many doubts .
As people see it , the United States is not returning power to Iraq out of its own accord . It is therefore impossible to have a complete transfer of power and there are bound to be many unexpected developments .
First , the interim transitional government set to be established in May next year is not to be directly elected by the Iraqi people but will be elected by the " transitional National Assembly " that is selected by 18 governorate selection caucuses .
This will be hard to be free from suspicion of the U.S. control and its legitimacy may be questioned .
Second , the United States has already announced that it will not withdraw its military forces after handing over the power . It will merely change the original " military occupation " to " military presence . "
The U.S. government announced on November 18 that it had decided to impose quotas on three types of textile imports from China , namely : knit fabric , brassieres and dressing gowns .
At a time when China is continuing its efforts to expand the economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States , it is deeply regrettable that the U.S. government should take this measure of trade protectionism .
At this phase of economic globalization , the new quotas the United States imposes on China textile imports are out of accord with the times .
First , this abuse of " quotas " hinders the implementation of the WTO 's principle of free trade .
Isn 't it too arbitrary and unfair to give pompous talks on free trade while backstabbing others with uotas at every opportunity in order to rebuild trade barriers ?
Second , " quotas " set a cap on the trend of development toward wholesome economic and trade relations between China and the United States .
Since China and the United States reached an agreement in 1999 on China 's accession to the WTO , the U.S. exports to China have enjoyed an average annual increase of 15 % .
From January to September this year , U.S. exports to China increased by 26.2 % over the same period of the preceding year .
In the past two years , U.S. exports of raw materials for textiles and finished products to China have risen sharply .
In fact , China today has become a country to which the U.S. exports have enjoyed the fastest growth among all the countries in the world .
There are many reasons why Bush 's visit to the U.K. did not accomplish its goal . The most important one is that after the Cold War was over , the United States has become the only superpower in the world , which has led to its total disregard of others and excessive unilateralism .
The United States launched the war on Iraq without the UN authorization . With no respect for the opinions of its chief allies on major international issues such as the rebuilding of Iraq , the United States persists in its own ways and has thus roused everybody fury .
A poll survey recently released by the EU Commission shows that 68 % of the EU citizens think the United States did not have adequate justification to launch the war on Iraq and 53 % believe the United States now poses a threat to the world peace .
Second , although the United States lays emphasis on fighting terrorism and wants its allies to contribute human and financial resources , it turns a deaf ear to their concerns .
With a firm hold on Iraq 's reconstruction projects , the United States gave major contracts in the first bid to the corporations in its own country , unwilling to share even a tiny piece of the pie with others . As for the dispute on the steel trade , the WTO ruled that the United States ' high tariffs have violated the regulations . People in the U.K. business circles had hoped Bush might make concessions during this visit , yet the United States eventually failed to clearly state its position .
Third , the United States put its own values as supreme guidelines above those of all other nations . Its insistence that Middle East countries carry out democratic reforms has been censured . Some allies request that the United States respect the culture and special features of Islamic countries . They believe that one of the reasons that the United States is deeply bogged down in Iraq is exactly the dire consequence of its " disrespect . "
However , Bush will not change his ways just because of the widespread criticism and opposition . During this visit , he again defended his Iraq policy and emphasized that the U.S.-British coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with the violence in Iraq .
Since Bush 's visit to the U.K. failed to accomplish its goal , the situation in Iraq will not necessarily develop the way the White House hopes for .
After more than six months of debate , an advance contingent of Japan 's Self-Defense Forces finally headed for Iraq before the end of 2003 .
This is the first time since the end of World War II that Japan has sent troops to overseas battlefields .
It reflects the will of Japan in becoming a political and military power and also signals a shift in its defense strategy .
The reason why this trip of the SDF has drawn so much attention is that it is not an isolated case .
Taking advantage of the war in Afghanistan , Japan made the breakthrough of letting the SDF go outside Japan . By using the problem in the Korean peninsula as an excuse , Japan passed the " Crisis Legislation , " making preparations for the SDF 's use of force or even preemptive strikes . Recently , the Koizumi cabinet again passed " The Basic Plan for Iraqi Reconstruction Assistance , " paving the way for the military dispatch to Iraq .
Step by step , this finally led to the breakthrough of the restriction of Japan 's pacifist constitution and military deployment to overseas battlefields .
In addition , Japan is also going to amend " Concept of Basic Defense Force " so that military deployment overseas can be made legal and permanent . It also plans to establish a " regular force " for overseas deployment that is not formed on contingency .
Meanwhile , the Japanese cabinet meeting , citing the so-called " threat of North Korea 's missiles as a reason , decided to start the deployment of the missile defense system by early 2004 . It imports the U.S.-made " Standard 3 missiles " and " Patriot PAC-3 " missiles to intercept exoatmospheric missiles and those returning to the atmosphere in order to build a two-tiered missile interception network .
It is easy to see that Japan 's SDF is evolving into a regular military force " for offensive as well as defensive purposes . " It seems that the so-called " SDF " " exclusively for defensive purposes " is going to exist in name only .
The reason why these actions by Japan have drawn so much attention is mainly because these military decisions are a challenge to Japan pacifist constitution .
After his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine , Koizumi defended his action in an interview with Japanese reporters .
His defense was self-contradictory and full of loopholes .
When asked by reporters why he visited the shrine , Koizumi replied : " The peace and prosperity in Japan are built upon the sacrifices of the war .
The purpose of my visit is to pray for peace and prosperity of Japan . "
We would like to ask whether Koizumi 's so-called " sacrifices of the war " include Class A World War II criminals such as Hideki Tojo .
Does it mean Class A war criminals also made their fundamental contribution to the peace and prosperity in the post-war Japan ?
Some reporter asked why January 1 was chosen for his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine .
Koizumi said it is the Japanese tradition to go to worship at the shrine on the first day of the new year and many people pay a visit to the shrine on this day .
It is understandable that ordinary people mourn for their loved ones and friends , and many survivors clearly expressed their opinion that their visit to the shrine is only for the purpose of remembering their loved ones and friends and that they strongly oppose honoring Class A war criminals at the Yasukuni Shrine .
The Chinese are a reasonable people . We have always insisted on differentiating the Japanese people from a handful of militarists and the ordinary public from the right wing . Ordinary people 's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine is not the root cause of this historical issue .
In unity there is strength .
This is an indisputable truth .
In order to realize the grand goal of building an overall well-to-do society and accomplish the sacred mission of rejuvenating the Chinese nation , we must unite all the forces that we can unite .
This must be the basic starting point and the closing point for the operations of the patriotic united front and the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference in the new phase of this new century .
We must further adhere to and perfect the system of the multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front , mobilize all the positive factors to the fullest extent possible , and continue to add new strength to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
In the past year , the CPPCC , with solidarity and democracy as its firm focuses , diligently performed all its due functions and played an important role in promoting the all-round economic and social development of our country and in maintaining a stable overall environment for the progress of reforms .
In this new year , we hope that the CPPCC will center its work around the Party and the government and further its efforts in political consultation , democratic supervision , participating in politics and political discussions , promoting its fine traditions , taking full advantage of its own superiorities , conducting investigations and studies at a deeper level , and actively giving advice and proposals so as to make new and greater contribution to the building of an overall well-to-do society .
From January 4 to January 6 , the 12th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , which had been postponed for an entire year , was held in Islamabad . The summit passed " Framework Treaty for SAFTA , " " Additional Protocol to SAARC Anti-Terrorism Convention , " " South Asia Social Charter " and other documents , declaring the commitment of SAARC member nations to the common development and cooperation in economic , cultural and anti-terrorism and other fields .
During the SAARC summit , the bilateral meeting between Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Musharraf drew special attention .
The handshake at the last summit between Musharraf and Vajpayee did not bring too much expectation on the development of relations between the two countries .
Two years later , as both sides took a series of major steps such as restoration of normal diplomatic relations , air and land transport links , and the successful cease-fire in the Kashmir region , the relations between India and Pakistan continued to ease and this eventually led to the top-level meeting at this SAARC summit .
As the two countries took another major step toward improving bilateral relations , the cooperation in South Asia is arriving at the new turning point for development .
Although Indian Foreign Minister Sinha said on the 4th that this meeting was or courtesy , people believe the meeting means the India-Pakistan relations will continue to be adjusted toward a more positive and pragmatic direction .
The leaders of the two countries have both realized that tension and confrontation go against the interests of their own respective country and only make them lose one opportunity after another in economic development .
With further development in globalization , strengthening the cooperation and revitalizing the economy have now become top priorities for the governments of both countries .
Although the result of the presidential election held on the 4th in Georgia has not yet been officially announced , the victory of Saakashvili , the National Movement leader who is a candidate jointly nominated by the right-wing political parties , is a foregone conclusion .
Georgia 's Central Election Commission announced on the 7th that based on the statistics of 89 % of votes , more than 95 % of voters supported Saakashvili .
Some heads of state from the Commonwealth of Independent States have also sent messages of congratulation to this young politician .
In fact , Saakashvili already declared his own victory as early as the very night after the election was over .
He called the result " the victory of the people , " and said that Georgia will act promptly to create a new future .
When interviewed by the news media , many voters said that casting votes for Saakashvili means choosing " a new hope . "
Even the former President Shevardnadze who was forced to resign also expressed his support for this former political opponent by praising him as " young , energetic and well-educated . "
While placing their hope on Saakashvili , people also noticed that not many changes have taken place in Georgia in the two months since Shevardnadze resigned .
In other words , what the president-elect has to face will still be the old problems .
The past year was a significant and extraordinary one in the development of our country .
We fought an extremely tough battle against the sudden epidemic of SARS and won a brilliant victory for that phase . Meanwhile , our economic development has maintained its excellent momentum and the average GDP per capita reached a new level of over 1,000 U.S. dollars . With the success of Shenzhou 5 manned space flight , the dream of space flight by the Chinese nation has become a reality . We have enjoyed ethnic solidarity and social progress and people livelihood is further improving .
The achievements made by our country in various fields are widely noticed by the world . For these achievements , the people of the whole country have contributed a great deal of work , demonstrating their fearlessness for hardships and risks , and courage and strength to create miracles .
We are full of confidence and hope for the new year .
The current situation both in China and abroad offers our country an important strategic opportunity that we must grasp for great accomplishments .
We will continue to use Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of three Represents as our guideline and fully implement the spirit of the Party 's 16th Congress and the 3rd Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee . We must conscientiously carry out the general guidelines and overall deployment set forth by the Central Party Committee on this year work and continue to push forward the reform and opening up as well as the modernization drive .
To do a good job for this year , we should make a correct assessment of the situation by identifying both favorable conditions and new opportunities on the one hand and unfavorable conditions and new challenges on the other . We should also heighten our sense of responsibility and urgency and awareness of potential adversities .
The three-party talks on issues of Iraq were held on the 19th in the UN headquarters in New York City . Annan , the UN secretary general , held discussions with representatives from Iraq 's interim Governing Council and the U.S.-British Coalition Provisional Authority with the focus on how the United Nations can play its role in rebuilding Iraq .
The talks covered such issues as politics , humanitarian aids , security in Iraq and the appointment of the UN special representative to Iraq , upon which the three parties exchanged their opinions in a candid manner .
At a time when the U.S.-British plan of transfer of power to Iraq is facing boycott , whether or how the United Nations will get involved in rebuilding Iraq certainly draws much attention .
Since the United States declared the end of major combat in Iraq in early May last year , the situation in Iraq has remained precarious . Attacks against the occupation forces were frequent , inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S.-British coalition forces that have enjoyed little lull of peace .
The former Iraqi President Saddam was captured on December 13 last year , but the U.S. euphoria did not last long . Security remained unimproved and resistance escalated , throwing the occupying authority into a dilemma .
On the other hand , the Iraqi people and Arab countries are unanimously demanding the pull-out of foreign troops and the return of power to Iraqis so as to let the Iraqi people govern their own country .
Meanwhile , the United States and Britain are trying hard to reshape the Iraqi government according to their own will , through which they plan to gradually and " gracefully " extricate themselves from the dilemma .
Therefore , the method and process of the power transfer have become the focus of the current Iraqi affairs .
The tentative plan of power transfer as proposed by the Coalition Provisional Authority and Iraq 's interim Governing Council last November is that the Iraqi interim transitional government to be formed by July 1 this year will be elected by the " Transitional National Assembly , " but the delegates to the assembly shall be selected and appointed by " Governorate Selection Caucuses . "
Whereas , the Shiites that make up the majority of Iraqi population stress that for a truly fair transfer of power to Iraq , a national direct election should be held .
U.S. Secretary of State Powell 's recent visit to Russia remains a focus of widespread public opinion .
This is partly due to the fact that the mutual relations between the United States and Russia , the two decisive powers , can have profound and far-reaching impact on the present world .
More importantly , Powell 's visit to Moscow is very substantive and sends a clear signal that dark clouds are looming over the relations between the United States and Russia .
If these dark clouds are not dispersed in time , the prospects of the bilateral relations may not be optimistic .
Despite the smooth and open channel of dialogue between Washington and Moscow , Powell decided to clarify his position in an article in Izvestia , a very influential newspaper in Russia .
Powell pointed out in his article that the United States was puzzled by a series of events in Russia 's internal affairs and diplomatic arena in recent months .
In his opinion , the political power in Russia is not yet fully tethered to law and the key elements of a civil society such as freedom of the press and development of political parties are not solidly established .
Russia policy on Chechnya and its attitude toward its neighboring countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States have caused all the more concerns from the United States .
To diplomats , using the mass media for a public statement of position is the " last resort " of communications .
The original intention of the United States in making such a choice is thought-provoking as it is clear that Russia is embarrassed and displeased with this choice .
With the advent of a new century , economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge to African countries .
The leaders of African countries have realized more and more clearly that Africa cannot afford to allow another opportunity to slip by and must actively seek ways to deal with the situation .
On July 9 , 2002 , the African Union was officially established and started operation . Since then , the African countries , while actively implementing the " New Partnership for Africa 's Development , " working hard to develop the economy and trying to get themselves out of the unfavorable situation in the economic globalization , have also been making every effort to resolve armed conflicts , the major obstacle in the rejuvenation of Africa , so as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .
At present , the overall situation in Africa tends to be easing off . The hot issues are obviously cooling off and all countries feel it more urgent to end the armed conflicts .
With the strong support from the United Nations and the international community , influential regional organizations , regional big powers and prominent politicians in Africa are all taking active actions , stepping up their efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate civil strife . Some conflicts and turmoil that lasted for years are now basically under control .
For example , a government of national unity was established in Congo-Kinshasa in June last year ; Sao Tome and Principe peacefully resolved a coup crisis in July ; the Liberian government and the rebel armed groups signed a peace accord in August in Accra , capital of Ghana ; the Sudanese government and the southern rebel armed groups started the crucial talks in September that broke the stalemate in peace process ; various Somali armed forces and political factions started a peace talk in Kenya in October to discuss the peace process in the entire country ; and the Burundi government and rebel armed groups signed a peace agreement in November and so on .
Of course , the current stability in Africa is still relatively tenuous and the peace achievements still need to be consolidated . And some potential or existing armed conflicts are still to be finally resolved .
In the meantime , the economic growth rate in African countries is still far behind those in the developing countries in Asia and other regions . These are all unfavorable factors in the development of Africa .
How African countries can effectively cope with the challenge of economic globalization and realize the dream of African rejuvenation still needs the long-term and arduous efforts on the part of the African peoples .
Recently , some parts of our country were hit one after another by the epidemic of the highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) .
The Central Party Committee and the State Council take the situation very seriously and have promptly made a series of major decisions , clearly setting forth the guidelines , policies and measures for prevention and control .
All relevant local agencies and departments are mobilized for the emergency , and are sparing no efforts in preventing the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the plans of the Party Central Committee and the State Council .
At present , the work on prevention and control of the bird flu in the entire country is being carried out in an intense but orderly manner .
HPAI is a type of animal epidemic that spreads fast and causes great damages . It wreaks havoc to animal husbandry and seriously threatens the health and safety of the general human population .
Since the effective prevention and control of HPAI is linked with the health and safety of the people , the development of agriculture and additional income of peasants , the overall economic development and the social stability , all local agencies and departments must follow the important thought of " Three Represents " as their guideline ; and in accordance with the requirements set forth by the Law on Animal Epidemic Prevention of the People 's Republic of China , they must strengthen leadership and act in closer coordination , rely on science , carry out prevention and control according to the law , mobilize the vast majority of masses for prevention and control , and handle cases in a resolute manner . Taking serious responsibility for the people and effectively implementing various prevention and control measures , they are determined to win this blocking action against the bird flu .
As the largest debtor country in the world , the United States has seen the increase of its foreign debt again .
The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced on January 16 that as of the end of September last year , the debt the United States owed various types of foreign creditors hit a total of 6.494 trillion U.S. dollars , up 2.2 % over the figure last released .
On the average , each American owes more than 20,000 U.S. dollars in foreign debt .
Coincidentally , the IMF had issued a study a week earlier , sending a systematic and sharp warning about the precarious U.S. financial foundation . It pointed out that the U.S. foreign debt , which keeps breaking records , has reached a level that poses a threat to the global financial stability .
Statistics show that private foreign investors control about 40 % of the U.S. government bonds .
This inevitably reminds us of Keynes ' proposal to President Roosevelt in the first half of the 20th century : Adopting a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home while making up for the financial loss by means of foreign debt .
This measure indeed played an important role in stimulating the " effective demand " to solve the impending economic crisis .
However , people have noticed that many U.S. administrations tended to use it as a " miraculous cure . "
But since the 1980s when President Reagan advocated tax cuts and military expansion , the U.S. deficit has been climbing up and the United States eventually has become the largest debtor nation .
The opening of the first round of six-nation talks was a major step toward the dialogue and peace process on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue .
Some consensuses reached by all parties during the talks have laid the necessary groundwork for the continuation of the talks and further outlined the goals , approaches and guidelines for the solution to the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue .
In the past few months , all parties concerned maintain that the nuclear issue on the peninsula should be peacefully solved through dialogue . Based on the results of the first round of six-nation talks , they conducted extensive coordination and consultation at different levels and made untiring efforts so as to bring about the second round of talks as early as possible .
In the meantime , North Korea and the United States also further demonstrated some degree of flexibility .
Now that major progresses have been made in preparations for the talks , we all hope that we should make the talks a success .
What the second round of six-nation talks can accomplish and whether the peace process can be continued are the general concerns of all parties involved and the international community .
In response , the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the goal of the six-nation talks is to maintain and promote dialogue and peace process . We are willing to work jointly with all parties to achieve that goal .
The basic starting point for the Chinese side is to maintain peace and stability in a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula .
The Chinese side believes that as long as all parties participating in the talks uphold their sincerity in peace talks , mutual respect , and equality in consultations , they will be able to create conditions helpful for the solution to the issues concerned .
The relations between the United States and Libya deteriorated in the late 1970s , and the two countries severed their diplomatic ties in 1981 .
U.S. President Reagan once made a lengthy list of crimes for Libya 's leader Qaddafi , accusing Libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and engaging in external military intervention and terrorism .
As the verbal attacks between the two sides escalated to military actions , the United States launched two surgical air strikes against Libya called " Prairie Fire " and " El Dorado Canyon . "
Since then , the United States had put Libya under economic sanctions , political attacks , diplomatic constraints and military threats .
However , Qaddafi did not give in under pressures .
Now seeing a thaw in the relations between the United States and Libya , some people attributed it entirely to the deterrent effect of the Iraq war . This seems to be rather biased .
In fact , Qaddafi , a man of extraordinary character , has been waving the olive branch to the United States over the years all along while he is engaged in the fight against the country . It is only a pity that he hasn 't got any response .
After the war in Iraq was over , all parties in the Middle East readjusted their strategies and regional forces were reorganized . This has provided a turning point for the restoration of diplomatic ties between the United States and Libya .
To Qaddafi , the restoration of friendly ties with the United States can end sanctions , rejuvenate economy , improve people 's life , and get his country out of isolation into integration with the international community .
By giving up what it hasn 't got and may not be able to get for some time , Libya can find a silver lining in an entirely new situation in return .
From February 7 to February 8 , top politicians in Europe , the United States and the rest of the world gathered in Munich , Germany , to attend the 40th Munich Conference on Security Policy .
The so-called " Munich Conference on Security Policy " is an international forum on security founded by a non-government individual and funded by the German government . In recent years , it has gained increasing attention especially after the Sept.11 attacks and has been honored as the " Davos Forum " on security .
One of the major topics for the conference this time is transatlantic relations .
The remarks by the top European and U.S. politicians either at the conference or outside the conference showed that both sides are trying their best to get rid of the dark shadow that the Iraq war has brought over their relations and are making every effort to resume their cooperation .
Bertram , director of the German Institute for International Politics and Security in Berlin , said that this was a meeting for the United States and Europe to repair their relations as both sides had the desire to get closer again .
The new message from the conference regarding the European and U.S. relations is that Europe and the United States need to restart the dialogue . They should seriously consider the common tasks both face and find the convergence of interests needed for the accomplishment of these common tasks .
Compared with the conference last year , there was no sign of belligerence at this year 's conference . Both parties are moving closer in their positions .
Although " Old Europe " represented by France and Germany was still resentful about the U.S. war on Iraq , it agreed to " look forward . "
Fischer , the German foreign minister , said at the conference : Although we hold different views about the war , we must jointly ensure peace in post-war Iraq . For that reason we must look forward .
He added that Germany will not hinder the NATO from playing a direct role in Iraq though it will not send troops to Iraq .
The United States has the most advanced modern media and monopolizes a substantial part of international press . The extent of Its propaganda has long reached every corner of the world and has virtually become ubiquitous . Why does it want to spend huge investment now in setting up a satellite television network that covers specifically the 22 countries across the Middle East ?
Quoting the head of " Alhurra " TV station , it is to provide Arab countries a news platform of " comprehensive and fair viewpoints . "
However , some analysts pointed out that " Alhurra " will be the strategic weapon used by the United States to carry out media infiltration , cultural invasion and psychological warfare in Arab countries . It is an important propaganda tool for the United States to implement its policy of restructuring the Middle East and reforming the Islamic world .
In that sense , " Alhurra " has an extraordinary mission which chiefly consists of three major points . The first is to spread " the concept of freedom . "
The United States considers the Islamic civilization a serious hurdle to the promotion of the modern Western civilization . The religious extremist forces in the Islamic countries in the Middle East are the breeding ground for the international terrorism that has a distinctive feature of anti-Americanism . In order to effectively combat terrorism , the Islamic world must be reformed so that it will identify with and accept the Western values , style of life and political system .
Through the subtle influence of " Alhurra " programs , the United States attempts to instill its own ideology in Arabs .
The second is to improve the U.S. image .
Externally , the United States adopts unilateralism and acts like a bully in whatever way it wants on many international issues . Such hegemony has infuriated the Arab countries and Islamic world .
After the Sept.11 attacks , the conflict escalated between the United States that has persistently favored Israel and the Islamic world in the Middle East .
Without any verified evidence and the UN authorization , the United States invaded Iraq by force under the pretext of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and counter-terrorism , arousing strong revulsion from the Muslim community .
As the talks between Pakistani and Indian officials were held in Islamabad from February 16 to February 18 , the hope of peace is rekindled across the South Asia subcontinent .
The officials from the two countries set the schedule and mode of talks for the future and established the mechanism for continuous dialogue . This move marks the resumption of the Pakistani-Indian dialogue two years after it broke off , and lays the foundation for the two countries to gradually solve all those pending issues including the Kashmir dispute . It is a demonstration of the precious sincerity for peace on both sides .
Prior to this meeting , most analysts were still cautious about the prospects of peace process though the relations between the two countries are thawing at a series of goodwill gestures from both sides , .
That is understandable . The memory of turbulent ups and downs in the Pakistani-Indian relations in recent years seems too fresh for anyone to guarantee that the sunshine upon the negotiation table today would not change into a thunderstorm over the borders tomorrow .
However , when Pakistan 's Foreign Affairs Secretary Riaz Khokhar , with a smile on his face , read the statement by the two countries on the 18th , optimism indeed prevailed and sent new hopes to many people who have been long concerned with the situation in South Asia .
First , the timetable set by this meeting is highly operative . Both parties not only confirmed the specific time and topics for the meeting but also decided on the different levels of meeting in accordance with the degree of importance of the topics .
Second , both parties learned the lesson from the Accra Summit in July 2001 when the direct dialogue between the leaders of the two countries ended in failure and adopted " a step-by-step " dialogue approach , starting the dialogue from the low level upward so that full preparations will be made for the dialogue of higher level .
Furthermore , after experiencing a series of ebb and flow of the bilateral relations , both countries agree that war is not a good solution to disputes and that both should stay away from war . This consensus has laid the foundation for the leaders of both countries to reach a common understanding in future that " there will never be another war between India and Pakistan . "
In order to completely and accurately understand and implement the principle of " one country , two systems , " we must integrate " one country " with " two systems " and " love of the nation " with " love of Hong Kong . " We must both respect Hong Kong 's high degree of autonomy and safeguard our country 's sovereignty . And we must retain the capitalism in Hong Kong while adhering to socialism in the main body of our country .
Only by doing this can we effectively safeguard the blessings of Hong Kong compatriots and meet the long-term interests of our country and entire people .
Since the return of Hong Kong , the Central Government has firmly implemented the principle of " one country , two systems " and strictly observed the " Basic Law . "
The vast majority of Hong Kong compatriots , as their own masters , have enjoyed unprecedented democratic rights .
With the strong support by the Central Government and the Mainland , Hong Kong has overcome various risks and challenges such as the Asian financial crisis and continued to maintain its position as an international financial , trade and shipping center .
Our practice has proved that " the principle of " one country , two systems " has strong vitality .
Today the republication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's speech two decades ago demonstrated to the world again the firm determination of the Central Government in implementing the principle of " one country , two systems . " Moreover , it serves to give everyone a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems " so that the great practice of this principle will be continuously pressed ahead .
Today , the Central Party Committee and the State Council held a grand ceremony here for China 's State Science and Technology Award .
President Hu Jintao presented the award certificates to the 2003 state top science and technology award winners , Academicians Liu Dongsheng and Wang Yongzhi .
The conference presented certificates to China 's manned space project that wins the State Scientific and Technological Progress Special Award and to the scientists who win the 2003 State Natural Science Award , the State Technological Invention Award and the State Scientific and Technological Progress Award .
On behalf of the Central Party Committee and the State Council , I hereby give my warm congratulation to all the winners !
I hereby give my sincerest greeting and highest respect to the scientific and technological personnel in all fields in the country !
To our country , the first two decades of this century mean an important strategic period that we must grasp firmly for great accomplishments .
We must concentrate on building an overall well-to-do society of higher level that will benefit billions of people .
To take full advantage of this strategic period and strive for achievements , we must attach greater importance and prominence to the development of science and technology .
After the Sept . 11 attacks , U.S. President Bush proposed the " preemptive strategy " in June 2002 and put it into practice in U.S. foreign affairs . In March last year , the first preemptive war was fought in Iraq .
The concept of " preemption " is not only inconsistent with the guideline of the international law that is centered on " mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity " but also will surely trigger the dangerous copycat effect , threatening the international order with new turmoils .
When the " preemptive " theory was first proposed , some prominent U.S. politicians asked the question : " What if other countries all follow the example ? "
Just as they expected , more and more countries claimed that they also want to go " preemptive " in the recent two years and their number is growing .
This is a new trend that warrants attention and study .
In the very month when Bush proposed " the preemptive strategy , " Australian Prime Minister Howard was the first one to stand up and show his support .
He said that Australia would adopt " preemptive " tactics and have no scruples about taking military actions in the neighboring countries once it received any confirmed intelligence that terrorists were to attack Australia .
He even proposed that the principle of " preemption " be written into the UN Charter as he considered it necessary to amend the UN Charter so as to give all nations " preemptive " rights to fight terrorists or countries that support terrorism .
In Northeast Asia , Japan 's Defense Agency proposed long ago in the White Paper on Defense released in July 1999 that Japan could launch " preemptive " strikes on foreign bases prior to missile attacks or military invasion .
After the war in Iraq , Japan became even more unscrupulous in its advocacy of the " preemptive " strategy .
Recently , there have been quite many international comments on the current U.S. Africa policy .
In this year 's January issue of " Foreign Policy in Focus , " a U.S. magazine , there is an article entitled " Africa Policy Outlook 2004 . " According to this article , the foreign policy of the Bush administration in the past year has directly or indirectly brought negative impact on Africa . In particular , the U.S. preoccupation with the war on terror and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and especially the U.S. presence in Iraq have greatly diluted its attention to Africa .
People still remember that in order to show its concern for Africa , the Bush administration set forth a " President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief " in January last year and promised to provide at least 3 billion U.S. dollars each year to Africa .
In July last year , President Bush successively visited five African countries of Senegal , South Africa , Botswana , Uganda and Nigeria and pledged 15 billion U.S. dollars in assisting African countries in their prevention and treatment of AIDS and another 100 million U.S. dollars for fighting terrorist activities in Africa . Other Africa aid programs such as food emergency program and education assistance program were also announced .
These aid programs were once greatly welcomed by African countries and won quite a lot of international acclaim .
However , one year has passed without any sign of concrete fulfilment by the United States .
Africa is in urgent need of assistance .
Entering the new century , Africa faces a host of challenges in its development all the more . In order to realize the " Millennium Development Goals " set forth by the United Nations in 2000 , work hard to reduce hunger and poverty , and promote health and education , Africa founded the " African Union " to take overall charge of African affairs and established " The New Partnership for Africa 's Development " aimed at promoting development in all countries . However , due to poor financial resources , lack of development funds has always been a problem .
The United Nations has repeatedly called for the developed countries to allocate 0.7 % of their GNP to be used as official aid to the most underdeveloped countries .
However , with its official aid only accounting for 0.1 % of its GNP , the United States has far failed the UN requirement and ranked at the bottom of the list of donor countries .
Recently , the European media has been discussing a hot topic : whether the " big three " summit of German Chancellor Schoder , French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair is gradually institutionalized .
The media calls the " big three " of Germany , France and Britain the EU 's " new troika " and the relations among the three countries the " new triangular relations . "
The " new triangle " is a new phenomenon . It remains to be observed as to where it is going . However , no matter from what perspective , the " new triangle " overall seems to be conducive to the unification of Europe and therefore will help Europe to play an important role as one pole of the multi-polar world in the international arena .
A survey of European history of a hundred years shows that the triangular relations among Germany , France and Britain have one basic characteristic : the alliance between Britain and France in controlling or opposing Germany .
Two world wars are the proofs .
In the era of Cold War , both East Germany and West Germany were respectively constrained by Warshaw Convention and North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
After the Cold War ended , the unified Germany became even more powerful , causing an imbalance of power in West Europe . The growing suspicion of France led to the temporary malfunctioning of Germany-France axis . As a result , Britain and France got close again with the same old intention of controlling Germany .
However , with " Germany-France axis " back into operation and the fierce conflict between the concepts of the unipolarization and multipolarization of the world , the EU has become seriously divided internally on the issue of Iraq in recent years .
The " old Europe " represented by Germany and France holds exactly the opposite position from that of " new Europe " represented by Britain and Poland on the issue of the Iraq war .
Furthermore , the split happens to occur exactly at a time when the EU is going to have the largest expansion in its history .
Egyptian President Mubarak recently made a speech on the reforms in Arab countries in Cairo and criticized the outside world for imposing an uniform mode of reform on Arab countries . He warned that such attempt could only get the opposite results and would do no good to the security and stability in the Middle East .
In his opinion , the reform measures should be based on individual characteristics and depend on resources available , while the uniform mode of reform ignores the cultural backgrounds , social customs and religious features of different countries .
At the same time , he also pointed out that Arab countries welcome outside help in the process of their reforms , but these efforts must fully recognize the different national conditions and respect the wishes of different countries so as to promote the reforms in political , economic and cultural areas in Arab countries .
The Egyptian leader 's speech represented the common view of Arab countries .
Under the current pressures of fighting against terrorism , preventing proliferation and conducting democratic reforms , the Middle East , as one of the hot spots in the world , is brewing new turmoil that will lead to new reorganization .
After experiencing the two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , how will Iraq , once considered one of the " axis of evil " countries by the United States , carry out political reconstruction ?
How will various kinds of political systems and social modes in the Middle East evolve ?
This is not only the concern of the Arab world and the international community , but more than that , it is also something that the United States and its Western allies are interested in .
After his meeting with visiting Bahrain 's Crown Prince Salman on the 9th in Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Powell reiterated that the United States wants to promote the " plan of Western democracy and capitalism " in Iraq and the Middle East .
He also stressed : " We are thinking about what else we can do and how we can institutionalize them . "
Last year was the year designated by the International Olympic Committee as the year of " culture and education . "
Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games ( BOCOG ) took this good opportunity to hold a series of educational activities that promote advanced culture and popularize the Olympic knowledge .
Among them , the publication of the " Secondary School Olympic Reader " chiefly for youth readership is one of the most important achievements .
The book , rich both in illustration and text , provides a systematic and vivid introduction of the Olympic Movement and the essence of the Olympic spirit mainly through story telling . It serves as good teaching materials that will help enhance young students ' understanding of the Olympic Movement and increase the society 's enthusiasm for participation in the Olympic Games .
Last year , BOCOG also designed a schedule of classes specially for young students that is printed on recycled paper with the logo of Beijing Olympic Games .
The concept of " Green Olympics " means that Olympic Games should be prepared and held under the guideline of sustainable development such as protecting the environment and ecological balance .
We hope these schedules of classes will regulate students ' behavior just as they set the schedules for classes and will gradually make them practitioners and advocators of the concept of " Green Olympics . "
Education is one of the core components of the Olympic Movement . It is also an important embodiment of " civilized Olympics . "
The real objective of Olympics is to educate young people with a new approach and from a new perspective and promote the harmonious development of both psychological and physical well-beings so that they will make contributions to building a peaceful and beautiful world .
Therefore , the combination of sports and education not only opens up a new world for the development of education but also makes the Olympic Movement more educational .
" Green Olympics " is one of the three concepts that Beijing upholds in hosting the 2008 Olympic Games .
It basically means to significantly enhance the environmental quality of the capital , create a beautiful environment for the Olympic Games and build an ecologically-friendly city .
To achieve these goals , we must extensively adopt environmental protection technologies and measures , proceed with a large-scale environmental treatment in various aspects and with afforestation and beautification of urban and rural areas , and promote the development of the environmental protection industry . We must constantly raise public awareness of environmental protection and encourage everyone to actively participate in various activities aimed to improve the ecological environment .
To effectively implement " a Green Olympics " is an important task for us to carry out the 3rd Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee 's proposal of adhering to the people-based principle and establishing the scientific viewpoint of comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development , and to promote a comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable economic and social development of the city of Beijing .
We must lay great emphasis on this .
In order to realize the goal of a green Olympics , Beijing municipality has formulated an " Olympic Action Plan " and " Ecosystem and Environment Protection Plan " based on the " Tenth Five-year Plan " and the " Bid Proposal " and set forth new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .
The goal of hosting a green Olympics will be fully realized through planning and step-by-step implementation .
On February 25 , the U.S. Department of State released its " 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices " and is again finding fault with the human rights conditions in more than 190 countries and regions including China . Assuming the tone of a " headmaster , " it labeled many countries as having poor human rights conditions , failing to meet U.S. standards , as bad as could be , while claiming some countries backslided in key human rights areas , and so on and so forth .
Of course , there are still some countries that have seen great improvements in their human rights conditions , such as Afghanistan and Iraq , but these are the " achievements " of the U.S. military in overthrowing the former regimes and " liberating " the two countries .
Yet how about the human rights conditions in the United States ?
Just as in previous years , the report made no comment .
To make up for the lack of report on the U.S. human rights conditions , the Information Office of China 's State Council released " the Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003 " on March 1 .
Citing a large quantity of factual evidence , the article presents many human rights problems in the United States and the U.S. infringement upon human rights of other countries .
Americans historically have a tradition of honesty and admitting mistakes made .
The well-known story about young George Washington cutting the cherry tree is a vivid example .
Now that it has become the only superpower in the world , the United States , on the contrary , seldom speaks the truth .
Recently , some change has quietly taken place in the coverage of China 's economic development by Japan 's mainstream media .
Contrary to the previous " China threat theory , " many media reports in Japan now start to hold the opinion that the economic development of China has promoted the economic recovery of Japan and that the demand of the thriving Chinese market has become an important drive for Japan 's economic development .
An article recently carried in the U.S. Newsweek also said that the rise of China is more an opportunity than a threat to other countries , especially to its neighboring countries .
The once widespread " China threat theory " is now being replaced by a " China opportunity theory . "
The " China threat theory " asserts that the development of China will pose a threat to other countries , especially its neighboring countries .
However , this assertion aimed at sowing discord is not accepted by China 's neighboring countries .
Former Malaysian President Mahathir once stated directly : " Asian countries have no need to fear China 's growing military and economic power because China does not have the tradition of invading foreign countries . "
In a published long-term plan , the Indian Defense Ministry also maintains that China poses no military threat to India .
In economic and trade fields , the governments and corporations of various countries all consider China their best choice for market expansion . Overseas investors with strategic visions are firmly validating the " China opportunity theory " through their actions : Of the Fortune 500 in the world , more than 400 have come to invest in China .
Over past consecutive years , China has topped the world in foreign investment attraction .
GDP is a globally accepted important macroeconomic indicator .
It is of crucial importance to maintain the growth of GDP throughout the entire process of our country 's modernization .
For the simple reason that an increase of one percentage point from the current GDP of our country can result in more than 800,000 jobs , we all must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth .
To realize the grand goal of building an overall well-to-do society and the third-phase strategic goal of modernization depends very much on the sustained rapid growth of GDP .
However , we should see that GDP , as an indicator , has its own flaw .
For example , it cannot easily reflect the quality and composition of economic growth accurately , cannot easily reflect the actual level of social welfare people enjoy , nor can it measure accurately the social distribution and social fairness , and so on .
On the other hand , GDP is not the only indicator .
Our assessment of political performance shall not look at the growth of GDP alone . We shall also look at the actual material and cultural life of the general public . We will look at the employment situation , social security and even social justice , social order , social management , social harmony , etc. in the area .
Therefore , we must treat the existing GDP verification system scientifically both in thinking and approaches and find the right place for GDP in the entire economic and social development .
We must maintain some level of its growth rate , but at the same time we should not overvalue it . And we should certainly not exclusively and purposely seek after it .
Since the Security Council delegation visited the six West African countries at the end of June last year , the overall situation in the entire region has seen encouraging changes , though the situation in a few countries turned back to turmoil for a time .
We are pleased to see that the government of Sierra Leone is making positive progress in enhancing the capabilities of its army and police and in stepping up control of the country 's diamonds and preparing for the election of local governments . The UN special delegation to Sierra Leone is also gradually scaling down according to the original schedule .
Equally encouraging is that with the deployment of the UN special delegation to Liberia , Liberia is gradually walking out of the turmoil brought by protracted wars and starting to embark on the road to recovery and reconstruction .
The political process in Guinea-Bissau has also made positive progress . The transitional government has promised to hold the legislative election in March this year .
The peace process in Cote diviore took a turn for the better again after suffering a few setbacks . All parties have promised to implement the Linas-Marcoussis accord . " The New Forces " announced its return to the Government of National Reconciliation and the Security Council is studying its plan to dispatch peacekeeping missions .
We expect that the Security Council will make the decision as soon as possible .
The Secretariat , ECOWAS and other relevant parties also worked hard to solve cross-border issues such as SALW trafficking , mercenary activities and recruitment of child soldiers from the perspective of the region and have achieved positive results .
While fully affirming the aforementioned progresses , we should realize that the overall situation in West Africa is in a way still precarious . Due to geo-political and historical reasons in particular , the countries in the region are closely linked and mutually influential . The turmoil in one country often affects the neighboring countries and even the entire region .
Therefore , just as proposed in the Security Council report , the international community , including the Security Council , must stick to a comprehensive and overall strategy in solving the issues in West Africa , and spare no efforts to tackle the cross-border issues . In the meantime , it must actively assist the countries concerned , the regional or sub-regional organizations such as the AU and ECOWAS and strengthen their capabilities to prevent and solve conflicts .
We share a common understanding that children are the future of the world .
We have the obligation to create the best and most suitable conditions to benefit their life , study , growth , maturity and success .
However , it is regrettable that thousands of children in the world today are still victimized by armed conflicts .
What they have experienced is turmoil and backwardness ; what they have seen is violence and destruction ; what they suffer is injuries and abuses ; and what they feel is sadness and helplessness .
Therefore , it is an important obligation of the international community to protect children from being harmed by armed conflicts .
All countries , especially those involved in the conflicts , should make their utmost efforts toward this goal .
We are pleased to see that in recent years the United Nations has taken a series of measures in promoting the protection of children caught in armed conflicts and has achieved positive results .
The Security Council passed in succession the four resolutions of No.1261 ( 1999 ) , No.1314 ( 2000 ) , No.1379 ( 2001 ) and No.1460 ( 2003 ) , which provide the important framework for protection of children .
The peacekeeping missions deployed by the United Nations in some regions regard the protection of children as an important task , which includes appointing child protection advisors and taking full consideration of children 's special needs when they assist the host countries in carrying out programs of disarmament , demobilization and social reintegration .
Some peace accords promoted by the United Nations or reached through the UN involvement also include a clause on child protection .
National reconciliation is an important condition for establishing long-lasting peace and stability in post-conflict regions .
After the conflict is ended , if the parties involved cannot bury the hatchet , it will be hard to truly consolidate the peace and the fire of conflict may even be rekindled .
Under many circumstances , to bring about post-conflict national reconciliation needs the joint efforts of all parties involved . At the same time it also needs the support and assistance of the international community , especially the United Nations .
For many years , the United Nations has played a useful role in helping and promoting post-conflict national reconciliation process and has accumulated a great deal of experience . Generally speaking , we believe , in order to successfully assist the post-conflict countries to achieve national reconciliation , the United Nations must properly handle the following three major relationships .
It must give consideration to the relationship between immediate needs and long-term goals .
National reconciliation usually takes a certain period of process and may not be accomplished in a single move .
Different phases require different focuses .
The first effort at national reconciliation is to get the former belligerents to bid " farewell to arms " and create a safe environment .
During this phase , it is very important that efforts should be made to disarm and demobilize the former belligerents and reintegrate them into the community .
We are pleased to see that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is getting stabilized ; ethnic relations are further eased ; initial success has been achieved in economic reconstruction ; the return of refugees has basically completed ; and its relations with neighboring countries is improving .
We are very much gratified about these hard won achievements in the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
We hereby express our congratulation on the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people and sincerely hope that all parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue their efforts to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and move forward with the peace process .
At the same time , we 've also noticed that the government agencies and their capabilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina still need further improvement . The reforms , especially in the judiciary and police , are still faced with challenges .
We think it is appropriate for high representatives to focus their work on this area for the first half of this year and we support the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in its active cooperation with high representatives .
We believe that with the help of the international community , the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to make new achievements in meeting the challenge of building their own country and embark on the road to autonomous development as soon as possible , which will lead to its successful integration with Europe .
The peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina are of great significance to the realization of lasting peace and development in the region .
The Chinese side has been watching closely the development of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina . Together with the international community , it will continue to make its contribution in assisting Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve long-term security and economic development .
China appreciates the efforts of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to promote the implementation of the resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) in all states and to help enhance the anti-terrorist capabilities of developing countries . It supports the CTC for strengthening its coordination and cooperation with the relevant international , regional and sub-regional organizations in the global war on terror .
At the same time , we hope that the CTC will step up anti-terrorist assistance and work hard to meet the actual needs of developing countries .
At present , the issue of rejuvenating the CTC has drawn the concern of most member states .
After many consultations , the CTC put forward an official report and distributed it as a Security Council document .
After more than two years of operation , the existing composition and mode of operation of the CTC indeed showed some deficiencies . For instance , member states were overloaded with reports , meetings and excessive paperwork ; working efficiency needs improvement ; and there is not sufficient coordination among the experts .
Therefore , we fully support the necessary reform of the CTC . We agree with the package plan proposed by the report about the establishment of a CTC Executive Directorate and others . And we also hope that all these existing problems can be properly solved as soon as possible , especially the problem of member states being overloaded with reports .
What I want to stress here is that rejuvenation and reform are an ongoing process . No matter what kind of reform is done , the CTC should always maintain its guidance and direction over the work of the Executive Directorate with regard to policies . Any policy making decision should all be made through consensus reached by consultations with the Plenary of the CTC .
In recent years , the issue of SALW has drawn the close attention of the international community .
This shows that all parties have increasingly realized the damage the proliferation and illicit trafficking of SALW have caused to the stability , post-war reconstruction and social development in the regions and countries concerned .
Fortunately , the United Nations has taken a series of effective actions to solve this issue .
In 2001 , the " Firearms Protocol " to the " UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime " and the UN SALW " Program of Action " were reached in succession .
They provide the legal and policy basis for proper settlement of the SALW issue and demonstrate the determination of the international community in cracking down the illicit trade of SALW .
In the past three years , great progress has been made in bringing " Firearms Protocol " into effect and implementing the " Program of Action . " The success of the United Nations ' first biennial meeting on SALW held in 2003 , in particular , has provided a new impetus to continuing the comprehensive and effective implementation of the " Program of Action . "
The resolution 58 / 241 passed by this General Assembly has decided that a working group be established to negotiate on an international document to identify and trace illicit SALW . This doubtlessly will further stimulate international efforts to combat the illicit trade of SALW .
Likewise , the Security Council has also placed increasing emphasis on the SALW issue and has conducted several special reviews and passed relevant chairman 's statements and resolutions .
Apart from that , the Security Council consistently emphasizes the importance of settling the SALW issue during its deliberation on a number of issues concerning protection of civilians , women and children in armed conflicts .
Economic development and poverty eradication are the basic prerequisites for ensuring sustainable development .
The sustainable development of economy is the material basis for environmental protection and all-round social progress .
Without solution to the issue of subsistence , there will be no development to speak of , let alone sustainable development .
To promote economic development and strive to eliminate poverty are the necessary steps that developing countries must take to achieve sustainable development .
Without solution to the issue of poverty in developing countries , the developed countries will find it hard to sustain their own development .
To use the resources rationally and to protect the environment are the necessary requirements for achieving sustainable development .
It is impossible for the development to sustain itself if it is achieved at the expense of squandering resources and ruining the environment .
Natural resources are not inexhaustible , yet the demand of human development continues to grow . If the relationship between the two is not properly handled , it will inevitably result in the deterioration of the ecosystem , which will seriously threaten the survival and development of mankind .
Only by adopting a recycling economy that is based on the most efficient use of resources and the protection of the environment can we achieve sustainable development .
To achieve all-round social progress and enhance the quality of people 's life are the ultimate goals of sustainable development .
My memory of the 9th informal APEC summit held a year ago by the Huangpu River in Shanghai still remains vivid .
Today , we gather at the picturesque Los Cabos at this side of the Pacific to discuss important plans of economic cooperation in the Asia Pacific region .
We are overjoyed to meet with our old friends .
I 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heart-felt thanks to President Fox for his gracious invitation and to the Mexican government for its meticulous arrangements .
In the past year , the continuous development of economic globalization and the rapid progress in science and technology have brought new opportunities for development for all countries .
In the meantime , the increased uncertainties in the world economic development have also posed new challenges to some countries and regions including the APEC members in their economic development .
With trade protectionism on the rise again , there is still a long way to go to achieve free , fair and equitable trade .
The fight against terror is arduous and complicated as non-traditional security threats have increased .
The world we live in is still not a peaceful one .
Although the international community faces a host of problems and other more may pop up unexpectedly in future , the ongoing trend of peace and development is not to be reversed , and the aspiration of the people of all countries for a better life remains unchanged .
It is very significant that development is the thematic topic for this dialogue meeting .
Development is the basis for the progress of human civilization and the key to solving various conflicts and problems the world faces .
Only by ensuring a coordinated , balanced and universal development of the world can we achieve long-lasting global peace and stability .
We should conduct a comprehensive and in-depth discussion of this issue and make concerted efforts to find its solution .
The accelerating economic globalization has become the most prominent feature of the current world economy .
Pushed by the trend of economic globalization , the relations among countries and regions have become increasingly close and the markets are getting more open . There has been an expanded and accelerated flow of capital , technology and personnel . All these have brought unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and promoting common development .
At the same time , the trend of economic globalization has also posed harsh challenges and broadened the gap between South and North . Some developing countries are faced with the danger of further marginalization . The increased economic and financial risks and the aggravating transnational crimes have also added to the urgency for international cooperation in jointly meeting the challenges .
At this juncture where opportunities and challenges coexist , we should seize the opportunities and meet the challenges . We should seek common grounds while reserving differences . And we should expand cooperation and push the economic globalization in the direction of common development and prosperity .
( International ) Flu Outbreak Peaks in U.S.
Xinhua News Agency , Los Angeles , December 31 ( Reporter Yan Liang ) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on the 31st that the worst flu in the United States in more than 30 years has peaked . Widespread influenza activities have been reported in 45 of the 50 U.S. states and the number of flu deaths has rapidly risen .
According to the CDC statistics as of December 20 , the number of flu deaths in the United States has hit a record high , accounting for 7.8 % of all deaths during the same period .
In the United States , at least 42 children have died of the flu , and the number of adult flu deaths is also rapidly rising though accurate statistics are not available at this moment .
According to experts , there are two reasons why the flu became epidemic in 2003 : first , since the flu virus is not the type of " Panama A " common in the past years , the vaccines manufactured earlier cannot offer effective protection against the virus ; and second , a surplus of flu vaccines last year in the United States has led two major vaccine suppliers to reduce this year 's production to 83 million doses , causing a vaccine shortage this year .
Although on average , 36,000 people die of the flu and 114,000 people are hospitalized with flu each year in the United States , it is rare for the flu to cause such public alarm as this year 's .
According to William Thompson , a U.S. epidemiologist , this flu is the worst in the United States in more than 30 years and it has also come earlier than usual . Quite a number of schools have reported widespread flu activities and long lines have formed at many flu vaccination stations .
In response to such serious situation , the U.S. Department of Health activated its emergency operations center on December 19 and dispatched teams of medical experts to all states .

( International ) Israel 's Deputy Prime Minister Denies Planning to Expand Settlements in Golan Heights
Xinhua News Agency , London , January 2 Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Olmert denied on the 2nd that Israel plans to expand Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights , saying there was neither such " plan " nor such " policy . "
On December 31 last year , Israeli Agriculture Minister Katz told the press media that Israeli government planned to double the number of Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights before it holds peace talks with Syria so as to increase the control of the Golan Heights .
In an interview with BBC , Olmert said Katz 's remark about the plan to develop agriculture , tourism and settlements in the Golan Heights was wrong .
He said : " I 've verified with the prime minister and the finance minister again and again in the past two days , and according to what the government promised , no such plan has ever been approved . "
He said that although some ministers are in favor of such plans , the government will absolutely not give support .
Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria during the third Middle East war in 1967 , and Jewish settlers currently total 17,000 .
As a result , Syria and Israel have been constantly at war .
Katz 's remark about the plan to expand settlements in the Golan Heights has given rise to immediate and widespread concerns of the international community . Syria condemned Israel 's expansion plan , emphasizing that it is illegitimate .
China 's High-tech Modern Weaponry Industry Takes Shape
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , January 3 ( Reporters Li Zhengyan and Li Bin ) In the past year , China North Industries Group Corporation ( CNGC ) , one of the ten largest military corporations in China , made major progresses in the research and manufacture of advanced and new weaponry and equipment and in the reform aimed at achieving profitability .
CNGC General Manager Ma Zhigeng said here on the 3rd that the company achieved sales revenue of 49.7 billion yuan in 2003 , up 19.7 % from the same period of previous year . As the entire system turned losses to profits two years ahead of schedule , the high-tech modern weaponry industry has started to take shape in China .
Weaponry manufacturing is the largest sector in China 's national defense science and technology industry and occupies a fundamental strategic position in the modernization of the national defense .
In recent years , CNGC has persisted in advancing science and technology and recruiting talented professionals . While concentrating on the research and manufacture of high-tech weaponry , it also implemented the reform aimed at achieving profitability and standardized management of civilian products . With its successful development and manufacture of a series of advanced and new weaponry and equipment urgently needed by the Chinese military , CNGC has obtained the research and manufacturing capabilities for high-tech military products .
In the meantime , CNGC aggressively moved ahead with its restructuring efforts . A total of 21 subsidiaries were declared bankruptcy and shut down ; the total number of employees was reduced to 360,000 from the 476,000 at the time when the corporation was established , which is a net reduction in force of 116,000 ; and 6 subsidiaries went public after reorganization .
( International ) Livestock Husbandry in Mongolia Took a Turn for the Better in 2003
Xinhua News Agency , Ulan Bator , January 5 ( Reporter Lu Guodong ) According to local media reports on the 5th , as of the end of 2003 , Mongolia had 25,307,800 heads of livestock , an increase of 1,623,300 heads over the same period of previous year .
This is the first time that the population of livestock in Mongolia has risen after it fell sharply for three years in a row .
Last year , there was abundant rainfall in summer and no heavy snow in spring and winter , which provided good conditions for a turnaround of Mongolia 's livestock husbandry .
As of the end of 2003 , the country boasted 255,600 camels , 1,958,300 horses , 1,784,300 cattle , 10,706,200 sheep and 10,603,400 goats .
Compared with the same period of previous year , the numbers of camels , goats and sheep increased , whereas the numbers of horses and cattle somewhat decreased .
The privatization of livestock husbandry in Mongolia was basically completed in the 90s of last century .
However , the privatization of livestock husbandry resulted in a total " dependency on weather . "
Thanks to favorable weather , livestock husbandry in Mongolia enjoyed six consecutive years of growth from 1994 to 1999 .
By the end of 1999 , Mongolia had 33,500,000 heads of livestock , setting the highest record in history .
However , three years of heavy winter snowfalls and summer droughts from 2000 to 2002 also caused livestock husbandry in Mongolia to suffer three consecutive years of setbacks .
By the end of 2002 , Mongolia had only 23,684,500 heads of livestock , a decrease of 9,815,500 heads over the three years .
( International ) North Korea Says It Will Counter U.S. Armed Forces with Military Forces
Xinhua News Agency , Pyongyang , January 6 ( Reporter Ji Xinlong ) North Korea Central News Agency made a commentary on the 6th , asking that the United States exercise goodwill in response to North Korea 's efforts to resolve the nuclear issue and saying that North Korea will step up its military forces to counter the U.S. armed forces .
The commentary said that in order to ease the tensions in the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and stability there , it is of essential importance to start dialogues to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue between North Korea and the United States .
North Korea has already made a proposal of a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions .
The commentary reiterated that it has always been North Korea 's principle and position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogues .
The U.S. government should exercise goodwill toward North Korea 's position .
However , the United States has recently shipped to South Korea large quantities of the weapons that have been tested in the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq and other advanced weapons and is accelerating preparations for provoking a new war .
The commentary also said " North Korea will respond to the U.S. hard-line policy of totally negating and deterring North Korea 's ideology and system with even harder counterattacks , " which is the choice of self-defense North Korea should make to safeguard its sovereignty and right of existence and ensure the peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula region .
As U.S. threats increase , North Korea will further reinforce its anti-imperialism military capabilities and counter the U.S. armed forces with its own military forces .
( International ) U.S. Service Still Lags behind Manufacturing in Growth
Xinhua News Agency , New York , January 6 ( Reporter Xue Yanping ) According to the report released on the 6th by the Institute for Supply Management , a well-known U.S. research agency , the U. S. service index dropped in December last year , signaling that at present , service growth still lags behinds manufacturing growth .
The report said that in December last year the index of service industry including retail , finance , construction and other non-manufacturing sectors dropped to 58.6 from 60.1 of the preceding month , contrary to economists ' earlier forecast that the index would rise to 60.5 .
According to the ISM standards , any reading above 50 in the service index means the industry is expanding , while any reading below 50 means the industry is declining .
According to another ISM report released on the 2nd of this month , the U.S. manufacturing index soared in December to the highest point in 20 years .
This shows that at present , the U.S. service growth still lags behind manufacturing growth .
While manufacturing growth helps to increase employment and promote economic growth , service growth plays an even greater role in reducing unemployment and boosting economic growth .

Shenzhen to Implement Health and Quarantine Inspection of Exiting and Entering Drivers against SARS
Xinhua News Agency , Shenzhen , January 8 ( Li Nanling and Hong Wen ) In order to effectively prevent the contagious SARS disease from spreading through Shenzhen 's ports of entry and safeguard public health , Shenzhen Inspection and Quarantine Bureau recently issued a public notice , deciding to implement a full range of health and quarantine measures effective on the 9th such as requiring all drivers passing through the three land ports of entry at Huanggang , Wenjingdu and Shatoujiao to take their body temperatures and fill in health and quarantine cards .
It is known that quite a large number of vehicles pass Shenzhen 's ports of entry . For instance , a daily average of 25,000 vehicles pass the port of entry at Huanggang , and as many as 10,000 at Wenjingdu . Therefore it is a daunting task to implement health checks of all drivers while keeping the ports of entry free from congestion .
To ensure that all exiting and entering drivers have their temperatures taken and health and quarantine cards collected , Shenzhen Inspection and Quarantine Bureau overcame all kinds of difficulties . Apart from dispatching internal employees to assist in the work at the frontline ports of entry , it has recently expedited the hiring of over 250 people and sent them all to work at the frontline after intensive training so as to ensure smooth traffic flow at ports of entry . At the same time , the bureau also purchased additional 60 portable infrared instant temperature measuring devices to meet the need of the work .
Shenzhen Inspection and Quarantine Bureau advises the relevant agencies and drivers who pass ports of entry that " Exit / Entry Health and Quarantine Cards " are available at the stations of the health and quarantine agencies at all ports of entry where " Exit / Entry Vehicles and Cargo ( Passenger ) Inspection and Quarantine Record Booklet " are exchanged or at the stations where temperatures are taken and health and quarantine cards are collected .
The bureau also calls for active cooperation between the relevant agencies and passing drivers in carrying out this measure to effectively prevent SARS from spreading through Shenzhen ports of entry and safeguard the health of general public .

ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet remarked on the very same day that the high exchange rate of the euro exerted a negative effect on the export industry in Europe ; however , he believes that the impact of the appreciating euro has been partially offset by the gradual recovery of global economy and rising consumer spending .
At the same time , he pointed out that the strong euro has also played an active role in stabilizing prices in the euro zone to a certain extent and therefore ECB decided to leave the previous interest rate unchanged .
Taking this remark as a message that officials in the euro zone are not concerned about the rising euro , investors started a sell-off of the U.S. dollar , causing it to drop against all other major western currencies while pushing the British pound to rise against the U.S. dollar to a momentary new high in 11 years .
At the close of New York Currency Market on the 8th , the ratio of euro over dollar rose from 1 : 1.2640 the previous day to 1 : 1.2761 ; the British pound against U.S. dollar rose to 1 : 1.8320 from 1 : 1.8180 after a momentary rise as high as 1 : 1.8354 ; the U.S. dollar against Japanese yen dropped to 1 : 106.17 from 1 : 106.27 ; while the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc was down to 1 : 1.2267 from 1 : 1.2398 .

Xinhua News Agency , United Nations , January 12 Syria 's U.N. Ambassador Fayssal Mekdad said on the 12th that although Israel 's President Katsav invited Syrian President Bashar to visit Jerusalem for peace talks , Israel must , first of all , consider the peace issue seriously and return the occupied Golan Heights to Syria .
Mekdad said unless Israel " seriously respects " the UN Security Council resolution requiring Israel to withdraw its forces from the Golan Heights , the invitation from Israel 's President Katsav will make no difference .

( Archeological Discovery ) 31 Qin Tombs Found in Fengxiang County , Shaanxi Province
Xinhua News Agency , Xi 'an , January 15 ( Tie Ma ) In the past , historians always believed that the palace area in the village of Sunjianantou in Fengxiang County , Baoji City of Shaanxi Province became a site for major royal sacrificial offerings only after the Qin people relocated their capital to Yong City , but the recent accidental discovery of 31 Qin tombs in this palace area by Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archeology may be expected to change this belief .
To meet the need of a company in Baoji City that plans to acquire the ruins for building its factory , Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archeology conducted an archeological investigation of the site , and in the urgently needed area of about 20,000 square meters , discovered 31 Qin tombs dating from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period .
After the excavation team of Yong City , Shaanxi Province , cleaned up and excavated these ancient tombs , over 40 articles of bronze ware , pottery and other artifacts were uncovered .
One of the Qin tombs contains two coffins and has a pit of two sacrificial horses near the tomb .
In this tomb were uncovered 15 articles of bronze ware and pottery . The bronze ware includes ancient freestanding cooking vessels , pots , axes , among others .
Among them , the bronze cooking vessel was superbly fashioned with exquisite decorative lines in a well preserved style of cast bronze from the Western Zhou Dynasty .
Judging from the sacrificial objects , the owner of this tomb was a Qin aristocrat in late Western Zhou Dynasty .
Assuming that , experts believe there should be a large cluster of ancient tombs nearby .
This unexpected discovery is of great historic value to the research on the relocation of the Qin capital and the structural layout of Yong City during Qin and Han Dynasties .
Tian Yaqi , associate researcher at Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archeology and head of the excavation team of Yong City , introduced that in the past , historians always believed that the palace area in the village of Sunjianantou became a site for major royal sacrificial offerings from Qin Dynasty to Western Han Dynasty only after the Qin people relocated their capital to Yong City .
However , this discovery shows that long before the capital was relocated to Yong City , this area was already a manor estate granted by the Western Zhou Dynasty and had its days of flourishing growth more than once .

( International ) Both Black Boxes Found for the Passenger Plane That Crashed over Red Sea
Xinhua News Agency , Cairo , January 17 After the joint marine rescue team of Egypt and France retrieved the first black box from the crashed passenger plane in the Red Sea on the 16th , the second black box of the crashed plane was also found in the depth of the sea on the 17th .
Hamdi Sami , head of the Egyptian rescue team , said the French submarine robot " Scorpio " is now retrieving the second box which records the cockpit voice and is expected to get it out of water by early morning of the 18th local time .
Both black boxes were found at a depth of more than 1,000 meters about 30 meters apart .
Shaker Qelada , head of the Egyptian Accident Investigation Commission , said the first black box recorded various technical data of the plane before the crash and will be " decrypted and analyzed " by laboratories of Egypt 's Civil Aviation Ministry .
Although the black box appears badly damaged , Qelada said it is " in fair conditions . "
The so-called two black boxes on the plane are actually colored light yellow .
They are designed to continue sending signals for 30 days after falling into the sea as deep as 6,000 meters so as to help rescue crew locate their positions for recovery .
The passenger plane that crashed over the Red Sea waters belonged to Egypt 's private Flash Airlines .
The Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed into the Red Sea shortly after taking off from the Egypt 's tourist resort Sharm el-Sheikh on the 3rd of this month , killing 148 , including 134 French tourists and a Moroccan as well as 13 Egyptian crew members .
The Egyptian and French experts think this crash was caused by technical problems rather than terrorist attacks or explosions and the recovery of the two black boxes on the plane will help reveal the answer .
China Makes Breakthrough in Cryogenic Preservation and Replantation of Severed Finger
Xinhua News Agency , Jinan , January 18 ( Reporter Su Wanming ) A severed finger successfully preserved in liquid nitrogen of -196 degrees Celsius resumed its life after it was surgically replanted .
Chinese scholars recently announced there has been a major breakthrough in the cryogenic preservation and replantation of severed fingers .
Recently , the department of hand and foot surgery at Shandong Provincial Hospital again performed a successful finger replantation surgery for a patient ( whose severed finger was preserved in liquid nitrogen of -196 degrees Celsius for five days . ) This is the second case of such surgery after the replantation of a severed finger ( preserved in liquid nitrogen of -196 degrees Celsius for 81 days ) was successfully performed at the hospital last year .
A consultation report by the Ministry of Health that runs a search for new medical scientific technologies certifies that so far these are the only two surgeries in the world that succeeded in replanting severed fingers preserved in cryogenic temperature .
Wang Zengtao , director of hand and foot surgery department at Shandong Provincial Hospital , announced : " After a large number of animal experimental studies and two clinical trials , we have basically mastered the technique of cryogenic preservation of severed fingers . "
According to Wang Zengtao 's introduction , compared with organs such as heart and kidney , the composition and structure of a finger , is more complex , including blood vessels , nerves , tendons , skin , bone , joints , ligaments and various tissues that form a complex tissue .
The technique of cryogenic preservation of severed fingers and its application involve a series of complex steps such as the formulation of freezing solution , the freezing procedure of organs , rewarming , replantation , and prevention and treatment of reperfusion injury .
The mastery of this technique has provided important experiences to go by for the related research on long-term cryogenic preservation of other human organs and their successful revival .

Although not all the problems have been solved , he said , new conditions have been established for the process of negotiation .
He believes that 2004 will be a decisive year in terms of formulating peace and security policies in the region .
Both Greece and Turkey are NATO members , but the two have conflicts of interest and clashes over maritime and air territories and continental shelf boundary disputes in the Aegean Sea and the issue of Cyprus , which have affected the normalization of their bilateral relations .
In recent years , Greece has adopted a policy of improving relations with Turkey and no longer interfered against Turkey 's accession to the European Union , which has greatly improved the relations between the two countries .

( International ) U.S. Troops in Iraq Kill 3 Non-Iraqi Arabs
Xinhua News Agency , Baghdad , January 19 ( Reporters Li Jizhi and Nie Xiaoyang ) Iraqi police disclosed on the 19th that U.S. troops in Iraq killed two Yemenis and one Syrian during a raid in search of weapons in the southern suburbs of Baghdad on that day .
Police said U.S. troops found the three people during a raid on " a terrorist hide-out " and shot the three dead when they refused to surrender .
The U.S. troops later searched the house and seized some rifles , grenades and explosives , etc .
The U.S. troops also arrested a Yemeni woman on the scene .
U.S. and Iraqi officials believe that some foreign religious extremists are penetrating the loosely guarded border into Iraq to work together with anti-U.S. forces in Iraq and launch terrorist attacks on the occupying coalition and pro-U.S. Iraqis .
On the 18th , a suicide attacker detonated a massive car bomb at the gate to the coalition headquarters in downtown Baghdad , leaving 24 dead and about 100 injured . Most victims were Iraqis .
( International ) Decline in Unemployment Rate in Silicon Valley Signals Recovery of U.S. High-tech Industry
Xinhua News Agency , Los Angeles , January 19 ( Reporter Yan Liang ) According to a report recently released by an influential economic development and research institute in the Silicon Valley of the United States , the unemployment rate in Silicon Valley is rapidly falling .
This is a clear sign of a beginning recovery of high-tech industries in the area .
In its annual report " 2004 Index of Silicon Valley , " the non-profit organization " Joint Venture Silicon Valley " said that the jobless rate from the second quarter of 2002 to the second quarter of 2003 in the valley dropped from 10 % of the previous year to 5 % .
According to the report , the jobless rate will continue to decline as high-tech industries gradually recover .
At present , the economic development in Silicon Valley is challenged by the need of a large number of well-trained and highly skilled workers to fill up the new job openings in the future .
The report said that of various kinds of high-tech industries in Silicon Valley , the biotech industry has the lowest jobless rate and the clearest sign of recovery . In 2003 , for the first time , the venture capital investment in the biotech industry in Silicon Valley equaled that of the computer software industry .
The report noted that the biotech industry will play an increasingly important role in the economic development in Silicon Valley .
The report also showed that the average wage of employees in Silicon Valley from the second quarter of 2002 to the second quarter of 2003 declined for the third year in a row , but the rate of decline was down from 6 % of the previous year to 1.5 % .
Silicon Valley is still a wealthy area in the United States where an average worker 's annual salary is 62,400 U.S. dollars , which is 60 % more than the national average .
However , the cost of living in the area is also 47 % above the national average .

( International ) Arab League Secretary General Urges U.S. Not to Impose " Democracy " on Middle East
Xinhua News Agency , Geneva , January 21 On the 21st , Mussa , secretary general of the League of Arab States , urged the United States to discuss democracy with Arab nations instead of trying to impose democracy on the Middle East .
In an interview with reporters at the annual meeting of World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland , Mussa said : " If they ( Americans ) want to establish democracy in the Middle East , they 'd better keep their promise and establish democracy first in Iraq . "
He said the Arab League is the best partner to discuss with the United States about carrying out democratic reforms in the Middle East .
" As long as you put forward your point of view and are willing to listen to ours , we can talk about any idea .
We don 't oppose democracy , but democracy is not an operation or order that has to be implemented immediately . "
Mussa said that the U.S. government so far has failed to convince people that its occupation of Iraq will bring " democracy " to the country .
" They said they were going to Iraq to show us a democratic model to follow .
Yet so far we haven 't seen anything . "
Tourism in China Estimated to have Fetched a Total of 487.4 Billion Yuan Revenue in 2003
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , January 22 ( Reporter Sun Yubo ) China 's tourism , both domestic and international , is estimated to have fetched a total of 487.4 yuan revenue in 2003 . It is a 12.4 % drop from the previous year , but the performance is better than expected .
Statistics from the National Tourism Administration show that the total number of inbound tourists in 2003 was 91 million , of which 11.3 million were foreign tourists and 32.7 million were tourists who stayed overnight in China , generating a travel revenue of 17.3 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange .
The number of domestic tourists was 870 million with domestic travel revenue of 344.2 billion yuan , a decrease of 0.9 % and 11.2 % respectively from the previous year .
Chief officials with the National Tourism Administration said that in 2004 the entire tourism industry will work hard for a full recovery of inbound tourist markets , continue to promote the flourishing growth of domestic travel markets and further regulate and restructure the operation of tourist markets .
At the same time , it will make all efforts for this year 's theme travel of Catch the Lifestyle and focus on planning and promoting a series of new travel products centered on this theme that reflect ordinary people 's lives in China .
( International ) Economic Experts Predict U.S. as Biggest Winner in Dollar Devaluation
Xinhua News Agency , Davos ( Switzerland ) January 23 ( Reporters Li Jie and Ding Xigang ) At the 34th annual session of World Economic Forum being held in Davos , Switzerland , a special seminar was held on the trend of dollar devaluation on the 23rd . Some experts predict that the United States will be the biggest winner if the exchange rate of U.S. dollar continues to slip .
Most participating economists think that U.S. officials including U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow seem to have already given up the " strong-dollar policy " which has been followed in recent years .
The declining exchange rate of U.S. dollar will provide greater space for economic growth in the United States and more employment opportunities . This is clearly evidenced in the manufacturing industry .
Meanwhile , the dollar devaluation will make U.S. products more competitive both at domestic and international markets , helping the United States to make up for its trade deficit .
However , experts think that the weaker dollar can also exert a negative influence on the United States .
First of all , the U.S. stock market will likely continue to decline . With the devaluation of various kinds of investment , foreign investors will withdraw their funds for fear of further dollar devaluation . Second , as imported goods become more and more expensive , the American people 's living standards will eventually decline . Third , any substantial dollar devaluation can also set off trade and financial turmoil .
However , the dollar devaluation will hit Europe , Japan and Canada even harder .
The drop in the exchange rate of U.S. dollar will put greater pressure on the European exports and push the European economy to the verge of a full-scale recession .
China to Speed up Development of Electronic Products in Fields Such as Automotive and Medical Applications
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , January 26 ( Reporter Feng Xiaofang ) China will speed up development of various kinds of electronic applications such as automotive electronics , machinery electronics , transportation electronics , and medical electronics to expand the space for growth in the electronic information industry as well as to satisfy various industrial needs .
According to chief officials with the Ministry of Information Industry , one of the major focuses in the promotion and application of information technologies is to reform and upgrade the traditional industries .
To promote the application of information technologies in various industries and increase the market share of domestic products and equipment not only meets the need of reforming and upgrading the traditional industries but also brings about precious opportunities for growth in the electronic information industry .
It is told that while expanding the space for growth in the electronic information industry to meet the needs of various industries , it is also necessary to support the set-up of a public technology service competence system , encouraging companies strong in research and development to provide technical support and warranty to the application of information technology in major industries by means of providing technical standards and testing environments .
At the same time , business practices such as technical services , management consultation and system integration should be developed , and support should be given to help establish a string of service industries like system integration suppliers and application service providers in an effort to promote the development of a new type of information service industry .
( International ) Japan 's Import and Export both Rose to New High in 2003
Xinhua News Agency , Tokyo , January 26 ( Reporter Le Shaoyan ) According to the statistics released by Japan 's Ministry of Finance on the 26th , Japan 's import and export trade volume both set the highest records in history in 2003 with a trade surplus exceeding again 1 trillion yen in a matter of three years .
In exports , last year Japan 's exports to the United States decreased by 9.8 % from the previous year but its exports to Asia enjoyed a dramatic increase of 12.9 % .
This not only made up for Japan 's decrease of exports to the United States but also increased Japan 's total volume of exports last year by 4.7 % over the previous year to a record of 54.5589 trillion yen .
In imports , due to the increased demand of energies such as oil and natural gas and their price hikes , Japan 's total import volume in 2003 increased 5 % over the previous year to 44.3202 trillion yen , similarly setting the highest record in history .
Japan 's trade surplus in 2003 was 10.2387 trillion yen , an increase of 3.6 % over the previous year , exceeding 10 trillion yen for the second time in a matter of three years .
Actual Number of Private-owned Enterprises in Guangdong Exceeds for the First Time That of State-owned and Controlled Enterprises
Xinhua News Agency , Guangzhou , January 26 ( Chen Ji and Hu Yanni ) Sources from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce of Guangdong Province said that in 2003 the actual number of private-owned enterprises in Guangdong exceeded for the first time that of state-owned and controlled enterprises , adjusting effectively the domestic funded enterprises .
According to statistics , as of the end of 2003 , there are 690,000 enterprises of various kinds ( including domestic-funded , private-owned and foreign-invested enterprises ) in total in the province , an increase of 0.59 % over the previous year .
Among them , there are 316,000 domestic-funded enterprises , a drop of 16.4 % from the end of previous year . The registered capital increased by 0.9 % to 1190.27 billion yuan . There are 323,000 private-owned enterprises with 452.28 billion yuan in registered capital , with increases of 24.9 % and 33.8 % respectively . There are 52,000 foreign-invested enterprises with 140.5 billion U.S. dollars in registered capital , with increases of 3.6 % and 4.1 % respectively .
For the first time , the actual number of private-owned enterprises exceeded that of state-owned and controlled enterprises .
Although the number of state-owned and controlled enterprises decreased in their structural adjustment , their actual clout steadily increased with average registered capital ( fund ) per company reaching 3.76 million yuan , an increase of 20 % as compared with that at the end of 2002 .
Statistics show that in 2003 , newly registered enterprises of all kinds in the province totaled 105,000 , forming a pattern of one drop and two increases .
Among them , there are 17,000 domestic-funded enterprises , a drop of 17.6 % from the same period of previous year , 81,600 private-owned enterprises and 6,561 foreign-invested enterprises with increases of 29 % and 0.08 % respectively over the same period of previous year .
The ratios of domestic-funded , private-owned and foreign-invested enterprises over the total number of newly registered enterprises are respectively 16 : 78 : 6 .
( International ) WTO Submits " Byrd Subsidy " Dispute for Arbitration
Xinhua News Agency , Geneva , January 26 ( Reporter Li Jie ) WTO announced on the 26th that the petitions of the EU and other seven WTO members to impose sanctions on the United States for its implementation of " Byrd subsidy " have been submitted to the arbitration agency .
The petitions for sanctions originated from the United States ' failure to repeal " the Byrd Amendment " within the deadline set by WTO .
" The Byrd Amendment " passed by the U.S. Congress in 2000 requires the U.S. government to subsidize the victimized U.S. companies directly with the punitive tariffs collected in the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases instead of sending them to the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
The U.S. move was opposed by its major trade partners including the EU and Japan .
WTO finally ruled in January 2003 that the amendment violated the rules of the world trade and required the United States to repeal it by December 27 of the same year .
But the United States did not implement the WTO ruling .
As a result , the EU , Japan , Canada , Brazil , India , South Korea , Mexico and Chile recently submitted petitions to the WTO , requesting the permission to impose additional duties on some products originating in the United States in amounts equivalent to those of the U.S. government subsidies .
However , the United States immediately challenged the extent of the sanctions and the validity of the petitions .
( Hong Kong , Maucao , Taiwan ) Retail Sales in Hong Kong Up 10 % during Spring Festival
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , January 28 Hong Kong Retail Management Association disclosed that retail sales in Hong Kong are doing pretty well during the lunar New Year . The industry has seen an average of 10 % increase of business revenue while some shopping centers have even enjoyed 20 % to 30 % increases .
Yu Pengchun , chairman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association , indicated the other day that mainland tourists taking personal trips to Hong Kong have helped in creating a shopping atmosphere in Hong Kong . The retail sales during the Spring Festival are doing very well in Hong Kong . Some sectors of the industry such as those of jewelry and apparel even enjoyed 20 % to 30 % increases of sales , with the spending of mainland tourists making up about 10 % of the total business revenue .
He said mainland tourists , using RMB credit cards in Hong Kong , have obviously stimulated the market in the Spring Festival . Each charge averaged 3,000 yuan . Some mainland tourists even spent as much as over 10,000 yuan .
Last year , the total retail revenue in Hong Kong dropped 4 % due to SARS .
Yu Pengchun predicts that with the economic recovery , the total retail sales in Hong Kong will have a single-digit increase , but the price of merchandise will be under pressure for upward adjustment due to the cost increase .
He said he believes the deflation in Hong Kong will be eased this year .
( International ) Denmark Releases New Act that Limits Immigration
Xinhua News Agency , Stockholm , January 28 , from Copenhagen : The Danish government submitted to the Congress a new act that will limit immigration on the 28th .
Under the act , children born in Denmark to foreign immigrants will no longer have the privilege of obtaining the Danish nationality automatically .
The act is the latest of a series of measures to limit immigration since the Danish Freedom Party leader Rasmussen took office as prime minister in November 2001 .
It is reported that the act is likely to be passed at the Parliament because Freedom Party has gained the support of the right-wing Danish People 's Party over the immigration issue .
The act requires that instead of obtaining the nationality automatically , foreign children born in Denmark apply for citizenship when they become adults just as other immigrants do .
Naturalized immigrants will be deprived of their citizenship if they have committed criminal activities that are seriously detrimental to the society .
In the past two years , the Danish government has released a series of measures to limit immigration , including setting limits on issuing long-term residence cards and on immigrants ' sponsorship of their relatives to come to Denmark .
Due to the Danish government 's unfriendly attitude toward immigrants , the number of foreign refugees in Denmark dropped from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
As a result , the traditional image of Denmark as a country boasting freedom and human rights has also been tarnished .
The achievements made by Singapore should not be taken as granted .
No matter how advanced science and technology are , I don 't believe people can maintain an ideal environment with higher quality and standards of living , full employment and increasing salary without making any efforts , keeping social disciplines or adjusting to changes .
These beautiful things do not come by themselves .
Only when the people in the entire country realize that they must give priority to group interests and make difficult compromises as well as necessary adjustments can everyone enjoy a beautiful future .
What will Singapore be like in 10 to 20 years from now ?
We all wish we could predict the future but the future is hardly predictable .
Many factors are beyond Singapore 's control .
The development of many things depends on the development of the world situation .
We don 't know when problems will pop up . More often than not , it depends on luck .
For example , three Singaporeans traveled to Hong Kong and ended up being infected with SARS . That was unpredictable .
In less than a month after the Spring Festival , three extraordinary serious accidents occurred in China , each killing dozens of people .
It is regrettable that there should be such a high frequency of accidents and heavy loss of human lives .
A few months prior to this , a natural gas blowout at a drilling well in Chongqing , gas explosions at several coal mines and frequent serious road accidents had resulted in hundreds of deaths .
Due to a vast area and dense population , China has a higher probability of disasters than any other countries and the resulting death toll can easily reach tens or even hundreds . Objectively , this is a helpless reality .
However , judging from common sense , fatal accidents in China are still far too frequent .
Among so many disasters , fire , explosions in coal mines , blasts in fireworks factories , and traffic accidents are the most common .
This at least shows two problems . First , the safety measures in these fields are the weakest ; second , people do not learn lessons from the past tragedies so that accidents of the same type keep happening .
In the past when Singapore was in a period of rapid economic growth , there were also serious fire accidents . However , the tragedies , still vivid in memory , quickly raised Singapore 's awareness of safety precautions in public places .
Likewise , China today is also in an extraordinary stage of rapid economic growth and social restructuring .
From time to time , there is news that foreign maids working in this country accidentally fall from buildings . Although the figure is not absurdly high percentage-wise , given the relatively safe working environment at home , the frequent occurrence of accidental falls from buildings by no means matches the virtually harmless nature of the job .
According to the statistics , a total of 99 maids of various nationalities died in accidental falls from buildings from January 1999 to June 2003 .
Behind these figures we see not only the broken families that waited in vain for the return of their daughters or mothers and the misfortunes that should have been avoided , but also the direction of our work to reduce these regrettable figures to the lowest possible level .
According to a statement recently published by the Indonesian embassy , 96 Indonesian maids have died while working in Singapore since 1999 . Some of them fell to their death from tall buildings during work .
The Indonesian government expresses its complaints from time to time about the accidental falls of maids and also set forth new regulations several times so as to rigorously control the qualification of Indonesian maids in our country and ensure their safety . However , the problem persists . As a result , the bilateral relations between Singapore and Indonesia are inevitably troubled by this maid problem .
What invariably puzzles us deeply is that compared with the number of casualties of guest workers at the construction sites , the number of accidental falls of maids is surprisingly higher . This could not but make people think there is more need to further investigate its background and causes .
Chen Kongli , a world renowned expert on Taiwan in the Mainland , recently published his new book entitled " Observing Taiwan . "
Most of articles collected in the book were all written in a period from the first rotation of political parties in Taiwan 's government in March 2000 to Chen Shui-bian 's assertion of " one country on each side of the Strait . " They are the author 's observations and reflections of the internal situation in Taiwan and the cross-Strait relations during the time when he " listened to what one said and watched what one did . "
Since it took two years for these articles written two years ago to be published , it is obvious that the Mainland has a very convoluted and time-consuming reviewing system for research papers on Taiwan . This shows the publication of " Observing Taiwan " has gone through an uphill struggle .
Since a long time ago , Chen Kongli has been taking an objective and truth-finding approach in his observation and study of Taiwan . He did not restrict himself to any subjective and preconceived political framework and endeavored to explore unique and truthful insights .
The reading of this book gives one an even deeper impression of this special characteristic .
Since the early 1980s , the study on Taiwan has become the " popular study " in mainland China . Various research institutes emerged one after another and all kinds of scholars and experts made their appearances and showed their talent .
Overseas , people generally divide the research institutes on Taiwan in the Mainland into the northern school and the southern school .
The northern school takes a relatively official stance with strong rhetoric . It more often assumes an overbearing Hawkish tone in some particular historic stages or in major political developments .
On the other hand , research institutes on Taiwan of the southern school are generally located in areas south of the Yangtze River , including Shanghai and Fujian .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 's " academic records " of " studying in London for two years " were exposed by the Japanese media as an exaggeration .
The Japanese newspaper " The Weekly Post " verified with the Office of Registrar at London University and found that during his nine-month stay in Britain , Koizumi only audited a few classes as a part-time student at the university and did not earn any academic degree .
The Chinese domestic media , big and small , vied with one another in reporting or reprinting this scandal to the great gratification of the general public .
Indeed , it is shocking that a prime minister of a country , imposing as he is , should fake his academic records to cheat his own countrymen .
It is all the more shameful that this should happen in the " imperialist " Japan .
However , if we view it from another perspective , we may find something positive in this scandal .
Moreover , these positive things are exactly what we lack and they also show the area where we urgently need to make improvements .
In recent years , we have been advocating " honesty and trust , " " building a sunshine government , " respecting people 's " right to information " and enhancing the " transparency " of the administration . However , the reality is far from our ideal .
Come to think of it . The falsification of a diploma by a country prime minister , while not a big deal by itself , can be exposed by the media and relentlessly pursued .
In such a country , what else cannot be brought under the sunshine ?
In Taiwan evening campaign rallies , major camps usually shuttle their people to the site in tourist buses . However ,
Not long ago , when Taiwan 's President Chen Shui-bian shouted " Let 's win the election ! " at a campaign rally somewhere in the north of the island , more than half of the audience did not give him the due respect of shouting with him because most of the local people have some relatives or friends who have gone to invest in the Mainland and the long overdue " three direct links " and the non-performing financial policy have many of them concerned .
If nothing unexpected happens , we can assume from opinion polls , underground wagers and other signs at this countdown time to Taiwan presidential election that Chen-Lu team will lose the election .
Unless more sensational developments come up , such as a major pan-blue split-up or an even more embarrassing scandal , Chen Shui-bian , who fought such a hard battle of winning the power from Lee Teng-hui , will have proved that he has failed to effectively win the popularity in the past four years and that instead he has allowed the green camp to stage a continuous variety show of corruption and low taste before the public , which has consequently weakened the confidence of his supporters .
How is Beijing going to deal with the pan-blue forces that may regain the power ?
First of all , we should understand that the pan-blue camp that may possibly regain the power is no longer the single big dominant party of the KMT but a combination of the blue and the orange and that there is the issue whether the internal tradition and the native faction can merge .
The current close cooperation during the election period cannot be regarded as necessary future relations .
If there are hopes of winning the election , internal restructuring will surely take considerable amount of time . The ensuing election of the Legislative Yuan at the end of the year will also make it very hard for the Lien-Soong administration to make any major changes in the cross-Strait relations ,
unless it realizes that the improvement of the cross-Strait relations can score points for Taiwan internal politics and is also confident of producing a positive result within a short period of time which , most importantly , can be felt by the general public .
Given this background , Beijing should temporarily hold its efforts to push for the reunification and allow Lien and Soong , the two leaders of the " traditional blue camp , " some time to consolidate the internal situation .
More than half a century has passed since the United States conducted its first nuclear explosion in New Mexico in July 1945 and dropped two atomic bombs in Japan in August of the same year .
Although the arms race between the two superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union led to a stockpile of nuclear weapons sufficient for the destruction of the entire world , fortunately both parties realized the danger of a nuclear war and refrained from pushing the nuclear button .
After the Soviet Union was dissolved and the world entered the post-Cold-War era , the danger of a large-scale nuclear war basically disappeared .
But meanwhile , the danger of nuclear proliferation increased rather than diminished .
The proliferation shows itself in two aspects .
In one case , some above-average countries with relatively rich resources and strength , out of their desire for regional supremacy , confrontation with their neighboring countries , safeguarding security or implementing blackmail diplomacy , are trying very hard to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons by all means .
In the other case , some non-state groups , especially the Islamic extremists who harbor an intense hatred for the West , are also seeking small-size nuclear weapons by all means to carry out bloody terrorist attacks on the West with no regard to innocent civilians .
In response to this demand , there have emerged middlemen who engage in the transfer and sales of nuclear weapons and the related technologies , and " nuclear black markets . " Moreover , their business is increasingly expanding in scope and has become an important part of the nuclear proliferation in the present world .
As a Chinese who grew up in the Hangjiahu region , images of rural areas and the peasant life in the old central east China still stay in my memory .
Returning to my hometown after many years , I found the lush green farmland along Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is strewn with three-storied houses built by peasants themselves , but I seldom saw anyone working in the fields .
This came as a real surprise to me . It is hard to believe that such tremendous changes have taken place for those people and lands that I have never stopped missing while living abroad .
However , I was greatly surprised and shocked by some reportage and scholars ' field surveys on the conditions of rural China that I read recently on the Internet .
I never knew that such an unimaginable dark side still exists in rural China and that the Chinese peasants are still living such a hard life in humiliation and without rights .
In " Chinese Peasants : a Survey , " a long reportage published by Chen Guidi and his wife after the couple conducted a field survey in the rural areas of three provinces of Anhui , Henan and Hebei , they voiced grievances on behalf of peasants and stirred up the Chinese society .
Based on a large number of facts that peasants were oppressed , exploited and even murdered for no apparent reasons by corrupted officials , they came to this conclusion : " When we came into closer contact with the Chinese peasants , we felt such a shock and anguish that we had never felt before . The poverty , evils , helplessness , resistance , silence and sadness we witnessed were all beyond one imagination . "
These are truly heart-wrenching words .
Just as anticipated , Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday and the general election for the new parliament will be held in the coming days .
To Abdullah , this election will be an event of great significance in his political career . To the political situation in Malaysia and its trend of development , the outcome of this election is also of landmark significance .
Only four months have passed now since Abdullah took over from Mahathir last November .
In spite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election ahead of schedule .
This at least has two implications : First , Abdullah is satisfied with his job performance for the past four months and is confident about the intent of voters . Second , he hopes to consolidate the foundation of his power by this means so as to emerge from the shadow of Mahathir .
Doubtlessly , Abdullah 's decision to hold a blitz election shows that he has already made a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in the country .
The current economy in Malaysia is performing well and there is no issue that the opposition party can make a big case of or capitalize to their advantages .
Besides , since Abdullah took office , he has taken some measures with relatively high publicity to fight corruption , such as arresting and prosecuting the former Land and Cooperative Development Minister Kasitah Gaddam on charges of graft . They not only earned him some favorable acclaims but also made the public optimistic about the future anti-corruption operations .
In the meantime , he urged to improve the efficiency of civil services , which is another action to boost people morale .
Since its establishment , the development and shaping of the European Union have been strongly influenced by the French politics and culture .
Seeking diplomatic independence and autonomy , the EU wants to be distinguished from the United States in its attitude and approach to handling international affairs . This guides the EU diplomatic policy and obviously reflects the subtle influence of France .
It is exactly for this reason that the international community , including China , Russia and Arab countries , all hope to see the rise of the EU as a completely independent force in international exchanges .
It must be admitted that since the late 1980s , the EU has indeed been working toward this goal in its diplomacy .
In December 1992 , all heads of state of the EU agreed unanimously at the Maastricht summit that all member states would implement a common foreign policy so that they would speak in unison to the outside world .
However , the so-called " Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU " met its first fiasco two years later in handling the issue of Bosnia .
From the Maastricht summit up till now , the EU 10-year diplomacy has achieved very little .
What is even worse is that the EU foreign policy utterly failed to withstand the test of major events .
The various positions the member states took on the U.S. war on Iraq not only proved this but also revealed once again the EU 's fatal political flaw . That is , it can be easily divided and ruled by other big powers and then won over one after another .
On February 24 , President Bush announced at the White House that he would support the constitutional amendment that bans same-sex marriage .
This is a clear shift from the equivocal attitude toward this issue he has adopted for months and represents an important development in politics during the U.S. presidential election year .
The constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the newly emerged Republican headquarters in the American South , but it also has an enormous negative effect . Since it is a heavyweight cultural dispute that divides public opinions nationwide , it doubtlessly will aggravate the political polarization in the United States and further distance the Liberal-dominated East and West coasts .
For Bush himself , who repeatedly claimed to be " a uniter " not " a divider " during the 2000 election , this is obviously a broken promise .
Moreover , as the young generation in the United States has become more and more liberal toward the homosexuality issue , this act of Bush , though effective in the short term , will do damages to the long-term interest of the Republican Party .
Bush 's new offensive of " constitutional amendment " can be described as his " scotched earth strategy " for this year 's presidential election .
Bush resorted to this ploy because he is losing his ground on the two major issues of anti-terrorist war and economy / employment and has to open up a new battlefield in religious and cultural issues that divide public opinions in the nation .
The U.S. attitude so far remains cautious .
In other words , since maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait can meet the long-term goal of the United States to strategically balance the power of the Chinese mainland , the United States will avoid any political and military conflicts with China resulting from encouraging Taiwan 's independence .
Understandably , it is not likely that the United States will completely eliminate the space for Taiwan to hold a referendum exactly as Beijing requested , but it will also take some pre-warning measures out of considerations for its own interest .
Recently , U.S. Secretary of State Powell , out of his own initiative , reiterated the existing policy on Taiwan and stated the U.S. opposition to Taiwan 's independence .
This demonstration of position is interpreted by the public as aiming at deterring and preventing Chen Shui-bian from going to the extreme .
The recent remarks made by some U.S. think tank personnel with government connections and the U.S. deployment of a large number of spy ships to the Taiwan Strait in the coming days to spy on the military activities of both sides of the Strait are indirect evidence that the United States is very much concerned with the situation in the Taiwan Strait .
It shows from another perspective that although the United Stats will not completely prevent Taiwan from holding the referendum as Beijing requested , it is equally concerned with the uncertainty of the situation in the Taiwan Strait during this period .
Any large-scale and one-on-one election eventually will have only one result . Either Chen Shui-bian is lucky enough to get reelected by a narrow margin , or Lien Chan reclaims the Taiwan Presidential Office .
What makes one worried is that due to unequal access to information , people from all sectors of society in the Chinese mainland seem to have not psychologically prepared for the possibility that Chen Shui-bian may still win the election .
In the event that the outcome of the election is not what has been expected , Beijing will again find itself in an unnecessary passive situation .
An ancient Arab saying goes : " One day 's turmoil is more horrible than a thousand years of tyranny . "
Is this what the Northeast Asian countries are currently worried about ?
I think the answer is probably affirmative .
A famous research and development center close to Washington D.C. and funded by the U.S. government examined in a recent study the four policy options to deal with North Korea 's nuclear crisis . They are engagement , containment and deterrence , economic sanctions , and preemptive strikes .
The attitude of the countries in the region toward these tactics is the focus of this survey .
In addition , the survey also analyzes the threats posed by North Korea 's nuclear weapons program based on the possibility of nuclear attacks and the potential damage they can cause as perceived by the peoples of North Korea 's neighboring countries and their sense of fear .
Both China and Russia consider the danger of North Korea 's use of nuclear weapons low or very low , while Japan and South Korea regard it as a significant threat .
All northeast Asian countries agree that they should keep engaging North Korea .
Japan , on the other hand , supports containment and deterrence . Other countries also consider the strategy of containment and deterrence acceptable under certain circumstances .
Singapore cares very much about its international rankings and pays year-long attention to country rankings in various areas released by the European and U.S. agencies .
Constantly being at the top of lists naturally adds to our interest in keeping track of rankings .
However , being No. 1 in every area has its own share of trouble .
In the opinion of most of our countrymen , you appear worried about being a loser if you pay too much attention to rankings , yet you look arrogant if you show off your rankings .
Therefore , people advise us that we should live a more elegant and carefree life and had better stand aloof from the worldly success .
As many people in the past would not deign to pay any attention to the rankings , there appeared a funny phenomenon that people no longer seemed to regard being " No. 1 in the world " as good news but rather tended to treat it as something embarrassing .
However , things have changed back in the past year or two .
We feel unsure of the long-term competitiveness of our country , and people in all walks of life also worry about their job security .
With this uncertainty , we no longer talk in an elegant and carefree manner as we used to .
In the intense global competition , being too elegant and carefree can give others a chance to catch up and surpass you and you may easily fall behind from your top rankings in every area .
On the outside , Bush appears to be pretty loyal to Cheney . At the meeting of Republican governors at the end of last month , Bush still promised solemnly that he would choose none other than Cheney for his running mate .
However , he also said half jokingly that just as in 2000 , he has placed Cheney in charge of finding a candidate for vice president .
Cheney , who always hides his talents and keeps a low profile , has made frequent public appearances lately in interviews with the media , denying that he will be replaced .
But he still left some room for himself .
He said he would not hesitate to bow out should he have health problems or feel himself a real burden on the president .
Cheney , 63 , has a history of four heart attacks .
Recently it is widely rumored that the U.S. military has actually encircled Osama , the mastermind behind the Sept.11 attacks , and is only waiting for the right time to arrest him .
As the voting for the presidential election is on November 2 , it is said that the Pentagon has already arranged for the good show of capturing Osama alive to be put on in October .
However , a long delay may give rise to hitches . Should Osama slip through the net , there may be no end of trouble for the future .
It seems that Giuliani , after all , is pretty much the trump card that Bush may count on for winning the votes .
The competitors for the 2004 U.S. presidential election have been confirmed : the Democratic candidate Kerry challenging the incumbent Republican President Bush .
They have started " warming up " activities such as campaign advertisements and election debates prior to the November election .
Their confrontation either orally or in written form may center on the three major topics of war , economy and social issues .
Bush believes that the war is closely linked with the national security of the United States . Either sending troops to topple Saddam or fight against terror , it is all for the sake of ensuring the security of the United States . Therefore , he tells his countrymen time and again : " We are at war . "
Kerry , of course , will point out that it is wrong for Bush to abuse the erroneous intelligence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction to launch the war on Iraq .
Speaking of economy , Kerry thinks Bush 's tax relief plan helps the rich and fails to create new jobs .
Bush shows Kerry : Aren 't the U.S. economic figures going up ?
As for the social issues such as the relationship between man and woman , Bush opposes same-sex marriage and abortion , and supports death penalty , whereas , Kerry is also aganist same-sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty .
How Bush and Kerry present their own viewpoints on these three major issues to the voters and convince them via ads , television and speeches will be all the political shows the two are going to put on for the next eight months .
However , on the diplomatic issues , Kerry has more room to show off his acting skills .
According to statistics , young people who choose to commit suicide are mostly teenagers 15 to 19 years of age , but it is also not uncommon for children as young as 10 to 14 years old .
Academic pressure is generally believed to be the cause of child and teenage suicide . However , studies find that emotional problems , especially those pertaining to sexual love and parental relationship , are actually the main reasons that local young people commit suicide .
Academic pressure and disappointment resulting from failed expectation also certainly pertain to the category of communication between parents and children .
The pressure of getting into a higher school is an inevitable burden on local school children during their growing up . Sometimes the pressure is self-induced , while more often the pressure is imposed on children by their parents .
Parents demand children have good academic performance and compare their own children with other children at every chance . Although the demand of academic excellence puts quite a lot of pressure on children , the mediation and communication behind the pressure are the true indicators of the relationship between parents and children .
If parents beat and scold their children or show blame on their faces when children 's performance is less than perfect , or even make children feel they are disappointments , they will doubtlessly push their children to helplessness and desperation .
It is known that many young students who need counseling became mentally disturbed after they were pushed into desperation by their parents ' over-expectations .
The success and rapid development of Singapore make parents feel their children are much better provided for than they themselves were and therefore they naturally expect their children to perform better than they themselves did .
More often than not , parents forget that they actually might not be particularly outstanding in all fields when they themselves were children .
At the age of one year and a half , most children are sent to boarding nurseries set up by various agencies or work units for a nominal fee . Children come home only once a week or even once a month .
Today , Singapore is facing the social issues of a declining birth rate and an aging population .
The young generation is too busy with keeping their modern life style and fashionable material comforts to respond to the government 's call for early marriage and childbearing .
I have a bold proposal to make : The government should take care of infants .
The people need only to be concerned about childbirth not childcare .
On the one hand , the government will sponsor setting up boarding nurseries and kindergartens and change elementary schools to full day care even with three meals provided , all for a nominal fee that citizens can afford .
This will not only create jobs for the unemployed , but also relieve the government from worrying whether such measures as infant bonuses , extended maternity leave , quality of maids , and tax rebates will work or not .
What Beijing needs to do is not only acting as the chief leader of the six-nation talks but also developing strategic deployment as soon as possible to take precautions in the long-term interest of China in the Korean peninsula .
Specifically , Beijing should urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons on the one hand , and start with reforming the Kim Jong Il regime and lead it toward modern civilization on the other so that it can eliminate the danger of a nuclear war in Northeast Asia and keep the status quo in the Korean peninsula , gaining more clout for long-term strategic negotiations with the United States .
In spite of its fierce facade , Pyongyang is actually weak inside and longs for economic development and integration into the international community .
Only this longing is often demonstrated by an outward appearance of aggressiveness , irrationality and complete lack of conformity with international rules .
In fact , Beijing has been using its influence and economic aid measures for some time to force Pyongyang to change its position that is not in conformity with international rules .
But this action still needs planning in all aspects .
Beijing 's aid to Pyongyang should not be limited to the economic field but rather be expanded to other social fields . The objective should not be limited to forcing Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program but rather should lead it toward modern civilization .
When Kerry first entered the arena , nobody thought he would have too much of a chance . At the time , all the spotlight was on Dean , the former governor of Vermont .
However , Kerry emerged like a dark horse in January prior to the Iowa caucuses and took the victory at the caucuses and primaries in the two most crucial states of Iowa and New Hampshire .
In the following primaries of other states , Kerry basically never lost except in the home states of other participating candidates .
Within only six weeks , Kerry became the front-runner from a candidate with almost no hope . All his rivals , including Gephardt , Lieberman , Clark , Dean and Edwards dropped out of race one after another , making people take a fresh look at Kerry for his political charisma .
In his 19 years of career as a senator , Kerry has always supported abortion and environmental protection policies and opposed tax relief plans that benefit the rich . He is dedicated to raising the minimum wage and finding a solution to global warming .
His working experience in Washington shows his willingness to confront social challenges and his courage in defying authorities and pursuing values with no fear of displeasing the interest of the minority .
China 's policy of reform and opening up started with agriculture . Rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of this policy .
However , in the late 1990s , the agricultural reform basically came to a standstill due to the dramatic shift in economic policy toward towns and cities , and the gap between urban and rural areas was further widened .
As time passes , two entirely different worlds have emerged in China , one is the highly prosperous urban China , and the other is the impoverished rural China .
To use a Chinese official jargon , the widening gap between urban and rural areas in China is " an issue of development , " and must therefore be solved through continued development .
In other words , the development of the coastal areas and urban areas in China should continue without being hindered by the problems in rural areas .
However , seeing some metropolitan cities undergoing small changes in a year and big changes in three years , people could not but ask why some impoverished areas have seen no changes in the past decades ?
Of course , we should recognize the fact that urban and rural areas have very different ways of development . But the question is when large amount of funds are invested in urban construction and encouragement and support are given to the wealthy middle class , have rural residents , who make up 70 % of the entire population , also been given the attention and emphasis ?
In theory , the Chinese governments , both past and present , have undeniably paid due attention to the issues of agriculture , rural areas and peasants .
However , as the conditions in rural areas have been more and more deteriorating in recent years , the emphasis given is obviously less and less adequate .
In any country , police , prosecutors and courts should not only be symbols of justice and fairness but also form the most important system of safeguarding social stability .
But unfortunately , they have become symbols of corruption in China .
According to the latest report from the National Auditing Department , the audition of the financial expenditures in the public security agencies in 26 provinces and cities last year shows that the public security agencies in the country had illegally collected a total of 16.5 billion yuan in fines and penalties .
The crisis of trust in police , prosecutors and courts has now come out into the open .
The cases of Liu Yong and Sun Zhigang and the recent " BMW " incident all reflect this profound crisis of trust .
The " BMW " incident is even more typical .
People are far more concerned with this issue than their concern with SARS during the SARS period .
In fact , what people are concerned is not the " BMW " incident itself , but the fact they could no longer trust the entire judicial system .
Being clearly aware of that , the relevant department soon put a tight lid on the media .
But , the problem is still there .
The second round of six-nation talks on North Korean nuclear issue ended the way it was generally expected .
During the talks , all parties concerned got together and explored the peripheral issues of the peninsula nuclear crisis and reached consensus on holding the third round of talks before the end of June this year , setting up a working group and other matters .
However , the talks yielded no progress on those substantive issues like how North Korea should scrap its nuclear weapons program and how the United States should afterwards ensure the political and military security in North Korea and provide North Korea energy aid . Instead it gave the feeling that the " fast knot " only got more tightened with each attempt to pull it loose .
Both of the two protagonists , the United States and North Korea , showed no concession ; and each stayed firm with its basic position .
What draws attention , however , is the U.S. attitude at the talks that showed no urgency to solve the problems and gave the impression of " footdragging . "
This tactic that the United States showed is closely linked with the new developments of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in these new developments .
The United States has never seen so many corporate CEOs jailed since Roosevelt became the president .
Is the recent exposure of a string of crimes in quick succession a result of coincidences or the explosion of the public or investor 's pent-up fury over corporate crimes and other illegal activities in the past three years ?
There may not be a simple answer , but it is a fact that the criminal activities of many corporations are exposed recently .
This bodes well for the recovery of economy and especially the restoration of investor confidence .
As the late 1990s might be the most chaotic and also the most elusive period in the history of the U.S. commerce , the sooner its impact vanishes , the better .
Once the curtain falls , the names of some companies are bound to fade into history , eventually ending up only in textbooks of business schools .
Whereas , other companies , such as Tyco and MCI , will work hard at reorganization to welcome the new round of economic growth under the leadership of new management teams .
When will the new round of economic growth come ?
As a CEO , you may not have the answer .
But this doesn 't matter , because Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan doesn 't know the answer either .
The Bush administration wants to adopt Keynesianism to stimulate economy by greatly increasing expenditures ( in particular , national defense expenditures ) on the one hand , and drastically reducing taxes on the other .
Internationally , the Bush administration continues to promote free trade while its trade deficit has hit a new high of 549 billion U.S. dollars .
However , the substantial tax-cuts failed to bring about any significant growth in investment and consumer spending .
According to the new Keynesians represented by the famous British economist Godley , the U.S. economy has been in such a mire that Bush 's financial strategy will not be able to salvage it .
They think that the so-called " law of markets " is only an illusion that inevitably leads to profits for the minority and losses for the majority .
People used to think that in the entire world the so-called profit-making minority are all in the United States , while the loss-taking majority are all in developing countries .
Now , things turn out to be otherwise .
Many in the U.S. economics community think that in addition to the U.S.-based multinationals , India and China have also become prominent current winners of globalization .
India has taken over the service economy , while China dominates in the manufacturing sector .
While people focus their concern on the mass transfer of the U.S. capital and manufacturing equipment to China , they fail to see the advantage of China 's labor market which is characterized by high skills and low costs .
First , whether the current situation in Taiwan is within or beyond Beijing 's assessment .
How Beijing made its assessment is known only to Beijing itself , but the result of the assessment can be inferred by outsiders from what can be openly observed .
For four years , the pro-independence camp headed by Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu has demonstrated its position in clear terms and efficient operation and actively proceeded with Taiwan 's independence .
In contrast , Beijing adopted a nearly routine tone occasionally punctuated by high pitch sounds and appeared indifferent to the progress of Taiwan 's independence .
However , it has taken a sharp turn since last fall . The magnitude of change is evident in the past few months as its capacity of handling took a wide departure from what it used to be in the 1990s .
Judging from this , it can be assumed that the current situation in Taiwan is within its assessment .
Second , take a look at the diplomacy with Taiwan .
The developments of the situation in the Taiwan Strait depend on whether major countries like the United States adopt a pro-Beijing or pro-Taipei attitude .
Since all countries are open about their attitudes , the answer is very clear .
As of today , all countries have not only been getting closer to Beijing with more concrete exchanges and growing more distant away from Taipei with less substantial exchanges , they have also started to give " mild but significant " advice to Taiwan 's democracy that has until now enjoyed praises .
