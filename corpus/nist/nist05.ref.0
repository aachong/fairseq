Bahraini Princess Marries US Soldier , Astonishing 5-Year Bond Comes to End
The star-crossed marriage between Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and US marine Johnson was once extensively feted on US television . However , it has come to an end in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after only five years .
Meriam is a member of the Gulf country Bahrain 's royal family . Johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair , Their fairy-tale marriage became the subject of a television movie .
But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that after only five years , the couple is headed to the court after Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions .
The pair met in 1999 when career military man Johnson was stationed in Bahrain .
But his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love .
Their union was forbidden by the royal family , so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to America .
After a bitter immigration battle with US authorities , the couple finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the famed and glitzy Las Vegas Strip when Johnson was 23 and the bride only 19 .
However , Johnson says that their star-crossed union comes to an end because of the temptations of the " Sin City " of Las Vegas , the constant tensions with Meriam 's rich and powerful family and rumors of an assassination plot against him .
Johnson says his work was to park the cars of hotel and casino guests while Meriam was increasingly tempted by the nightlife of the gambling city , frequenting clubs late at night and ignoring her husband .
Meriam abandoned her husband a year ago .
" She 's gone off the deep end , " Johnson says .
This Week 's Eurozone Economic Indicators to Show Continuous Economic Weakening in Europe
Economists said that Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while British data is expected to show a pick-up in industrial activities .
They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to be volatile from one month to the next , but the longer-term trend of output will point to slowing economic growth .
The most important economic indicators of the week will be in Germany , where the ZEW institute 's economic expectations index , which is due on the 7th and is closely watched by the market , will offer Europe its first evidence of economic confidence in December .
The ZEW index fell sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 the previous month .
Economists said the significant appreciation of the Euro will have continued to weigh on economic confidence in the latest survey , so there is no reason to expect any rebound in the economic expectations index .
" Given that the main factors driving down economic confidence , including the Euro 's appreciation , uncertainty over global growth and the weak labor market and worsening unemployment in Germany , have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period , a strong rebound is unlikely , " BNP 's economists said .
According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News , the AFP financial news subsidiary , the index will drop again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month .
However , Teather of UBS investment bank said Germany 's ZEW economic expectations index could drop as far as zero in December .
" Expectations of future German economic activity , as reflected in the ZEW survey of analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall in our view , " said Teather .
Ukraine Crisis Causing Tensions between East and West to Dominate OSCE Meeting
Russia has been accusing the West of interfering in the affairs of Eastern Europe , which has gradually become a focus due to the political crisis in Ukraine and is expected to top the agenda of the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which will open tomorrow .
Russia is irritated by the creeping influence of the West into corners of Europe it previously considered its backyard , like the Baltic states , Georgia and central Asia . As a result , the recent incident in Ukraine is likely to dominate the discussions of the two-day OSCE meeting in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia .
Ukraine 's Supreme Court has made a dramatic ruling to order a re-voting of the recent second-round presidential election . And before this , the European Union had called on member states of the OSCE to ask their observers to get ready for " the quickest and efficient actions " .
According to European sources , the number of OSCE observers will increase to 1,000 from the original 600 in Ukraine 's re-election scheduled for December 26th .
US Secretary of State Powell will attend OSCE 's annual meeting , which is perhaps his last foreign tour before leaving office .
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov , French Foreign Minister Barnier , British Foreign Minister Straw and German Foreign Minister Fischer will also be attending the meeting .
The OSCE groups the 55 states of North America , Europe and Asia . It will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its founding next year .
The organization was established at the Helsinki conference , which helped end the Cold War .
Bush 's Major Test : Intelligence Reform Bill to Face Congressional Vote this Week
The intelligence reform bill the US congress will take efforts to pass this week is part of an ambitious second-term agenda pushed by Republican President Bush , whose support level among Republican congressmen will be his first major test after re-election .
In a newspaper interview yesterday , Kean , the Republican who led the investigation into the September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York and Washington , said the issue with the intelligence reform bill was that it has to be passed by the Congress and that the matter itself augurs ill for bipartisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .
" Congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and Congress can 't get these big issues taken care of , and then we 're all in trouble , " Kean said .
" It 'll be a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the Republican and Democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80 % of the American people in the polls , " he told The New York Daily News .
Several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the groundbreaking reform bill could delay overhaul of America 's antiquated spy network by months , years or kill it altogether .
The top Democrat on the House of Representatives ' Intelligence Committee , Harman , yesterday told CNN television that " if the bill isn 't passed this week , it dies " .
Congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 before adjourning until early next year .
If lawmakers fail , the entire bill will be discarded and need to be rewritten in the Congress ' 2005 session .
Ukraine 's Opposition Strongly Opposes Large Constitutional Amendment to Dilute Presidential Powers
Ukraine 's pro-West opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing Ukrainian President Kuchma before the second round presidential re-election .
The constitutional reform will dilute most of the president 's powers .
With the November 21st vote declared invalid by the Supreme Court because of massive vote fraud in the second-round presidential elections and a new date of re-election set by the Central Election Commission for December 26 , opposition leader Yushchenko is locked in a fresh standoff with Kuchma .
" If the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . This would be unacceptable , " said Timoshenko , an ally of Yushchenko .
" We want the president to be able to name the head of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor general so we can fight corruption and get rid of the clans that dominate Ukraine 's political and business life , " she told reporters .
Kuchma , who keeps close ties to Russia , had pushed for constitutional changes before the re-election amid fears that the opposition could win the presidential election .
Opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote for government-proposed constitutional changes and the parliament adjourned for 10 days .
According to the constitutional amendment , the power to appoint all top posts excepting the prime minister , defense and foreign ministers would be transferred from the president to the parliament , where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority .
According to the amendment , the president 's nominees for the prime minister , defense and foreign ministers would need to be approved by lawmakers , who could also put forward their own candidates .
Ukraine 's Political Crisis Enters Third Week with Opposition Calling for Continuous Protest
The chaos caused by Ukraine 's presidential election has entered its third week . Opposition leader Yushchenko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing President Kuchma dismisses Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential reelection .
Tens of thousands of Yushchenko 's supporters have gathered in the capital of Kiev for two weeks , blocking the government buildings and encamping themselves on major avenues designed by Soviet experts to hold military parades . The people power they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of presidential election of December 21st and the Central Election Commission to order a reelection for December 26th . The parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych , but Kuchma , Yanukovych 's mentor , has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor .
Yushchenko told supporters gathered at the capital 's Independence Square this evening that Kuchma should dismiss his government , and reshuffle the Central Election Commission . In addition , both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud .
" Before these decisions are made , the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed , " he said , starting his campaign for the December 26 election .
" Over the past 14 days , the square has shown the love for Ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of Ukrainian people who can defend their own choice . "
" We are undergoing a fight between good and evil . The world is applauding our victory and is proud of Ukraine , " he said .
As the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by Moscow and Yushchenko and Kuchma are once again locked in a standoff of constitutional reform , Polish President Kwasniewski , Lithuanian President Adamkus and Russian envoy Gryszlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation .
Egypt Announces Breakthrough in Stalled Middle East Peace Process
Egypt says a new framework is expected to come into being for the Middle East peace agreement .
It also says it is likely to return its ambassador to Israel in the near future to restore the full diplomatic ties severed four years ago .
Quoting " high-level " Egyptian sources , Egypt 's state news agency , the Middle East News Agency ( MENA ) , said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation .
" An important understanding has been reached by Egypt , Israel , the Palestinians and the significant international parties , such as the United States and the European Union , agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , " MENA said .
Following the death last month of veteran Palestinian leader Arafat , the international community has revitalized its efforts to advance towards a final Middle East peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine .
MENA said officials expect that " preparations would take place until July , after which political action will begin " .
MENA said it will be followed by a conference in Washington attended by all parties concerned with the peace process , notably Israel and Palestine , as well as Egypt , the United States , Russia and several European countries .
Topics of the meeting are expected to include a " bilateral ceasefire " and the Palestinian Authority " putting a stop to anti-Israeli attacks and consolidating its control over the situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank . "
For this point , MENA said Israeli Prime Minister Sharon has promised to " stop Israeli military operations against the Palestinians insofar as they continue to respect the ceasefire deal and control their territory . "
One Billion Children Suffer from War , Poverty and AIDS
The United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children , half of the world 's population of children , suffer from poverty , war and the scourge of AIDS .
UNICEF says the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing , as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child , are regularly imperiled , due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms .
UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out during the release of the report in London that " when half the world 's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy , when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS , we 've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood " .
" Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood , " Bellamy added .
UNICEF has joined hands with researchers from Britain 's London School of Economics and Bristol University to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world .
Researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter , 400 million have no access to safe water , 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million ( mostly girls ) have never been to school in the world .
Researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of " severe deprivation " , which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities .
The 10th annual UNICEF report released today points out that war and AIDS have destroyed networks that normally protect children and at times turned them into direct victims of war and AIDS .
EU Resists Chinese Pressure to Lift Arms Embargo
The European Union today rebuffed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on China from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , but said it was working towards lifting the 15-year-old ban .
The EU Dutch presidency made the remarks following a China-EU summit .
The Netherlands says it cannot speculate how the EU will end the embargo .
The EU imposed the arms ban on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
Although the arms embargo overshadowed the China-EU summit , the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements .
Both China and the EU claim that such deals have strengthened their " strategic partnership " .
" The EU side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " said the EU in a joint statement made after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao .
The statement points out that the Chinese delegation " welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU . "
Wen Jiabao didn 't hide his displeasure at a press conference following the summit . He said the ban " does not reflect the partnership between China and the EU " .
" The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between China and the EU , " Wen Jiabao said .
A group of EU countries led by France is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted , saying the ban is outdated .
But some in the EU worry that without a strengthened set of EU rules , a lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales which could improve China 's military strength .
" I have explained that the EU is willing to lift the embargo but I also must say that this is related to adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports , " said Dutch Prime Minister Balkenende .
Preliminary Research Finds Folic Acid May Be Linked to Breast Cancer But Link Not Confirmed
A new health study points out that folic acid , a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects , has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer .
But the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance , as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer , so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement .
Folic acid , found naturally in dark , leafy vegetables , is known to be a key aid in the growth of the fetus .
Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960s were given supplements of either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folate , or a placebo , mostly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy .
The study published in the British Medical Journal says that by September 2002 , breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five-milligram supplement as for those who took the placebo .
One of the researchers , Ness , has stressed the results were merely " preliminary бн intended to point the way towards further research " .
" It 's entirely possible that this is a chance finding , so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is one , before we reach any conclusions , " he said .
Ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements .
He says there is a " considerable difference between the trial " and current dosage recommendations .
According to British health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a 0.4-microgram daily supplement of folic acid иC more than 10 times smaller than the doses given to women in the study .
Two Candidates in Widely Different Mood as Ukraine Holds Presidential Re-election
The two rivals set to meet in Ukraine 's presidential re-election on the 26th this month have got ready for the runoff .
The pro-West opposition leader Yushchenko is confident of wining the election while the pro-Moscow incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych says he will no longer represent the " shameful " ruling party in the election .
Meanwhile , Russian President Putin has changed his attitude towards Ukraine 's entry into the European Union , saying he supports its entry into the EU .
Asked how many votes he would garner in the re-election , Yushchenko told a crowded press conference , " Conservatively speaking , I should win around 60 % of the votes . "
On the other hand , Yanukovych , looking anxious and upset from his appearance , directly dodged answering reporters ' questions several times , saying at last , " For God 's will , we will win . "
Yanukovych , who was originally chosen as a successor of incumbent President Kuchma , has changed his mind and positioned himself as a rival candidate against both the opposition and the ruling parties .
" I used to trust those cowards and traitors working with the government but I 'm very disappointed now . The government is shameful , " he said almost directly giving the names .
Kuchma and the opposition reached a compromise to transfer part of the presidential powers to the parliament by amending the law to end two weeks of massive opposition protests and political chaos since the presidential election on November 21st .
Yanukovych 's victory in the election has been declared invalid by the Supreme Court by reason of massive electoral frauds and a re-election must be held .
Powell Visits Hague in Final Push for EU-US Harmony in His Term
US Secretary of State Powell today held talks with senior officials of the European Union to make one last effort to push forward US-EU unity in his term .
Powell 's European tour is aimed at mending the diplomatic impairment between the two sides that has resulted from the Iraqi war . Hague is his last stop .
It will likely be Powell 's last official overseas trip in his term . The EU has promised him they will continue working to ease strained bilateral ties ahead of US President Bush 's February visit to Europe .
However , differences between the two sides still linger .
" We have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground during the second term of President Bush , " said Dutch Foreign Minister Bot , whose country currently holds the EU 's rotating presidency .
EU External Relations Commissioner Ms. Waldner says she believes Europe and the United States have already made progress " to put the difficult moments of the Iraq crisis behind us " , but she still acknowledges that it is a " key moment in the EU-US relationship " now .
Bush will fly to Brussels on February 22nd to meet with EU and NATO leaders .
Powell says Bush 's visit is aimed at mending the fissures caused by the Iraq issue .
Powell has visited Sofia and Brussels during this European trip but has only made limited progress in improving ties .
In Brussels in particular , Powell criticized six anti-war European NATO members for hurting the " credibility and cohesion " of the alliance by refusing to attend the training exercises in Iraq .
However , Powell still firmly holds that his meetings have shown the US 's commitment towards fully restoring diplomatic relations .
Basescu Elected Romanian President , Faces Challenge of Forming Government
Romania 's opposition candidate Basescu won a fierce presidential election today but the center-right mayor of Bucharest is likely to face big challenges when forming a new government due to the large number of parties in a split parliament .
According to the final official results announced today by Romania 's Central Election Commission , Basescu , candidate of the " Justice and Truth Alliance " , had won 51.23 % of the votes while his rival ; Prime Minister Nastase had won 48.77 % .
Nastase has conceded the defeat and expressed his congratulations to Basescu .
Outgoing President Iliescu has also congratulated Basescu .
Nastase says his Social Democratic Party will help Basescu to enable Romania 's smooth entry into the European Union .
The Social Democratic Party won a victory in the parliamentary election of the 28th last month .
" Today my priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for Romania to join the European Union . Romania must make efforts to satisfy the demands for the EU entry , " Basescu said in a press conference .
He stressed that the Romanian people should know what cost would be paid for the integration . The nation must be united to ensure that there would not be voices suspecting the integration .
Romania has completed negotiations on the EU entry and is expected to join the bloc in January of 2007 .
Basescu has also put the fight against poverty and corruption and ensuring legal independence as his priorities .
Dispute over Past Work Remains ; Oliver Stone Seeks Peace with Turkey
Movie director Oliver Stone is in Istanbul today promoting the new film " Alexander " and hoping to repair an old rift with Turkey .
His screenplay for the classic " Midnight Express " has been criticized for tarnishing the image of Turkey .
" I never intended it to be against Turkey . It was against injustice everywhere , " he told AFP in an exclusive interview .
Public opinion in Turkey has denounced Stone since the first screening of the award-winning film in 1978 .
The film was based on the memoirs of Billy Hayes .
Hayes , a young American , was sentenced to 30 years in jail in Turkey after a protracted legal saga that began when he was caught at Istanbul Airport trying to smuggle hashish out of the country .
Critics in Turkey have accused Stone of willfully interpolating Hayes ' original book and writing a racist screenplay in which every Turkish character , without exception , is depicted as a villain .
The film is also rife with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture .
Stone has acknowledged that " perhaps some of the zealousness , some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much , too hard " .
But he added , " It was true that Hayes did get screwed in the Turkish prison . He was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years and he was treated brutally in prison . So this is all documented . "
" The larger picture is that Turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not working properly . America has similar problems , " Stone said .
Japan 's Economic Growth Likely to Slow Down Next Year
Japan 's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year .
While huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to Japan this year after a decade of stagnation , analysts now pin their hopes on a booming China to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between Japan and China .
The evidence is mounting that Japan 's economy could slump briefly in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a glut .
Under a recently adopted new data methodology , Japan 's economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1 % in the July-September quarter , narrowly avoiding a technical recession .
At present , economists still differ in their views about the robustness of Japan 's economic recovery .
According to estimates by BNP Paribas researchers , Japan 's economy will record a 2.3 % growth in real terms for both the current fiscal year ending in March next year and the fiscal year that follows .
They call 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the US economy is firmly on a recovery track and Japanese consumer spending is taking up the slack for slower exports .
Another relatively pessimistic view is from UFJ Institute economists who expect only 1.8 % growth in the current fiscal year and an even slower 0.6 % for the following fiscal year .
They have cited the " potential risk " that corporate profits have failed to lead to higher personal incomes .
French Foreign Minister : Middle East Peace Process to Test French-US Ties
After a meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today , French Foreign Minister Barnier said that resuming Middle East peace talks would be a " test " of their trans-Atlantic relationship .
Following the death of Palestinian leader Arafat , France called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between Barnier and Powell after their meeting .
Barnier flew into Washington from Paris for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his designated successor , National Security Adviser Rice , before turning around and heading to Brussels for a European Union summit .
Both Paris and Washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the US invasion of Iraq last year , but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the Middle East impasse .
" We want to improve future relations between France and America and Europe and America , " said Barnier , after a short meeting with US Secretary of State Powell .
" I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis , " he said .
Barnier called early this week for an early international conference on the Middle East to take advantage of what he termed a " window of opportunity " created after Arafat 's death last month .
But Powell has not made any promise .
He said the two had spoken of a British plan to hold a meeting bringing in the Palestinians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held .
US officials say they have made it their priority to promote the Israeli-Palestinian peace to ensure smooth Palestinian elections next month .
The election will produce a leader who could rein in Islamic militants and resume talks with Israel .
Foreign Minister Machimura Proposes Japan-South Korea Talks for Next January
Japan 's Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold talks on a free trade agreement ( FTA ) as early as January next year .
Jiji Press reports that during a meeting with the South Korean Foreign and Commercial Minister , Ban Ki-Moon , in the southern Japanese city of Ibusuki in Kagoshima county , Machimura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible , since both Tokyo and Seoul wish to conclude the FTA by the end of 2005 .
The talks between Machimura and Ban Ki-Moon followed the summit of the 17th between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun , who urged Tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against North Korea .
Prime Minister Koizumi is under great public pressure to punish North Korea over its abductions of many Japanese nationals during the Cold War .
The families of kidnapping victims were outraged after Japanese researchers concluded last week that Pyongyang presented the remains of other people in a bid to prove that two kidnapped victims were dead .
Apart from the abduction issue , Koizumi and Roh Moo-Hyun mutually agreed that the six-nation talks aimed at halting North Korea 's nuclear weapons development should resume as soon as possible .
Since a standoff starting in October 2002 resulted from North Korea 's secret development of a nuclear weapons project , three rounds of six-party talks have taken place and ended without concrete results .
North Korea has boycotted the fourth round of six-party talks scheduled for September this year .
Members of the six-party talks include South Korea , North Korea , the United States , China , Japan and Russia .
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Still Expected to Win Next February 's Election
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident he will win a second four-year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarnished by a failure to quell a deadly separatist insurgency .
With national elections slated for February 6 next year , Thaksin and his political adversaries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year .
A total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in Thailand . The bird flu swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand , where the government admitted it had " made mistakes " in its handling of the epidemic .
However , the health concern is unlikely to unseat Thaksin . Instead , many are asking only how thorough his victory will be , and what will it mean for the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .
" The phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at Thaksin , he has managed to capture popularity for the time being , " Kraisak , Chairman of the Senate 's Committee on Foreign Affairs told the AFP .
" But things will start to disintegrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and associates ) , the social injustices and the violence , " he said .
It is because of social injustices and violence that chaos erupted in Thailand 's Muslim-majority deep south , where a sporadic separatist insurgency occurred continuously starting in January .
Since January this year , radical Muslims have targeted Buddhists , government officials and security forces in shootings . They also carried out bombing attacks and beheadings . More than 560 people have been killed and another 100 are reported missing so far .
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Claims Arafat Poisoned About One Year Ago
Late Palestinian leader Arafat 's Cabinet Secretary Abdelrahman reveals that Arafat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his Ramallah headquarters .
" Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago . It was on September 25 , 2003 , " Abdelrahman told Al-Hayat newspaper .
" The president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vomit .
It was from that moment that the president 's health started slowly deteriorating . "
Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11 .
Some senior Palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned .
However , French doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations .
Two weeks before the delegation 's call on Arafat mentioned by Abdelrahman , the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon 's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove Arafat , although without specifying by what means .
The Israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for Arafat , who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters .
" Arafat shook hands with people , who had come to express solidarity with him in his confinement by Israel , " Abdelrahman recalled .
On September 25th last year , Arafat received two delegations , one group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission and another group of political activists .
" The last time Arafat became ill , on October 12 this year , he had the same symptoms : vomiting , refusal to eat and all the symptoms of a flu , " Abdelrahman pointed out .
Bush Recognizes Iraqi Troop Training Needs to Be Improved and Fully Supports Rumsfeld
US President Bush admitted today that the Iraqi army was not ready to replace US troops , and warned that the election scheduled to be held on January 30th next year would not be an end to serious violence in Iraq .
During a one-hour press conference , Bush also expressed his support for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , firmly believing that the Pentagon chief would " fulfill his duty " .
Bush says that despite some occasional serious differences , he has pledged to continue cooperation with Russian President Putin , adding that it is the right time to move on a road leading to the end of conflict in the Middle East .
He also believes that the best way to deal with the issues of Iraq and North Korea , existing members of the " axis of evil " , is through multilateral diplomatic mediation .
Continuous car bombing attacks yesterday shocked the Iraqi Shiite Muslim 's two holy cities of Najaf and Kabala , killing 66 people and injuring more than 200 others . Bush has recognized that violence has made the Iraqis pay a price but insists that the election in January will go ahead .
Bush has warned the Americans that the Iraqi election " is only the beginning of the political process " . He also warns " we certainly don 't expect a smooth process . "
Bush has also admitted that the training results of Iraqi security forces are a mixed bag .
" Sometimes , when there is fierce fighting , they ( Iraqi troops ) will run away , " he said .
He says such Iraqi troops can never protect the national security , which is unacceptable .
But he believes that after being trained for a long time by the US army , Iraqi forces will achieve good training results .
White House : Iraqi Rebels ' Attempts to Sabotage Election Doomed to Failure
In response to rebels ' attack at noon today on a restaurant in a US military base in Iraq 's major northern city of Mosul , which has killed 22 and wounded over 60 others , White House spokesman McClellan said that as the Iraqi election is coming nearer , terrorist activities by Iraqi rebels will become more rampant but such " enemies of freedom " will surely be eliminated .
Reports from Iraq say that a large explosion occurred in a military base restaurant during lunchtime causing heavy casualties among the US soldiers .
The Iraqi interim government is scheduled to hold the first election since the overthrow of the Hussein regime on January 30th .
The United States has dispatched nearly 20,000 more troops to ensure the security of the Iraqi election .
The total number of US troops during the election will reach 150,000 .
McClellan says the nearer the election is , the more terrorist attacks rebels loyal to Hussein will launch in an attempt to undermine the interim government . They want to turn back to the past but " they will be defeated and they are being defeated " .
As for a recent poll that shows about 56 % of the American people believing the war in Iraq is " not worth fighting " , 57 % disapproving of Bush 's handling of the Iraq situation and 52 % believing Defense Secretary Rumsfeld should resign , McClellan says President Bush has never been one to govern based on polls .
" Polls are snapshots in time , and we are working to continue to build upon the progress being made in Iraq . "
Mourners Attend Funeral of Philippine Political Figure Poe
A large number of Filipino fans attended today 's funeral for this country 's most renowned movie star , Poe . The event was held under tight security amid fears of unrest .
Sixty-five-year-old Poe was a defeated presidential candidate .
Mourners accompanied Poe 's coffin as it was pulled through the streets of the capital Manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .
Many riot police were deployed near Malacanang Palace because of concern that Poe 's supporters could erupt into violence .
These people have accused President Arroyo of rigging the presidential election on May 10th .
The army has also raised an alert , as intelligence had pointed out a coup was to have taken place to replace Arroyo with Poe 's widow Roces .
However , the funeral and burial went off peacefully . Movie fans chanted Poe 's initials FPJ and waved presidential campaign posters used by him .
Poe died on December 14th after suffering a stroke .
Crying women and children showered the coffin with flowers as the hearse 's procession wound its way to the cemetery .
Malacanang Palace , close to the route of the procession , was barricaded with huge shipping containers as Justice Secretary Gonzales warned that some parties could use the funeral to stir up trouble .
Gonzales said a " credible intelligence report " indicated that there was a conspiracy by some people to use the funeral march and burial to incite the people to turn against the government .
But army spokesman Colonel Pascual said the coup plot obviously fizzled out after the military deployed troops to guard important areas .

Armitage Warns Syria to Cooperate with US on Iraq and Lebanon Issues
US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage warned Syria today , saying the development of future ties between Damascus and Washington rests on whether Syria is willing to cooperate with the US on the issues of Iraq and Lebanon .
Armitage was again putting more pressure on Syria in an interviewed by Arab reporters .
The State Department made the interview public earlier .
" I certainly hope the ties will be improved but this depends on how Al-Assad 's ( Syrian president ) group will do , " Armitage said when asked if he expects continuous tense relations between the US and Syria .
The number two figure of the US State Department pointed out that Damascus should implement Resolution 1559 adopted in September this year by the UN Security Council to stop all interfering actions in the neighboring country of Lebanon as soon as possible .
Armitage said what Syria is doing " doesn 't go against the US but rather the whole international community " .
Asked if the US will bring the question of Syria 's refusal of cooperation into discussion when the UN Security Council discusses next January whether UN peace-keeping forces will remain in Lebanon or not , Armitage replied , " We are most likely to do that . "
Talking about the Iraqi issue , Armitage recognized that Damascus has indeed taken some actions in line with the US expectations , such as strengthening joint border patrols with Iraq to cut off rebel 's funding .
However , he pointed out that Syria " needs to make greater efforts " .
AIT and CCNAA Sign Lease for New AIT Building Site in Neihu Today
The American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) and the Coordination Council for North American Affairs ( CCNAA ) today signed a lease for land in Neihu for construction of AIT 's new office building . Director of AIT Taipei Office , Douglas Paal , says that the new building is currently being designed and hopes that construction can be completed at an early date so that AIT can operate in a safe , secure and modern environment .
Douglas Paal and John Chen , Director General of CCNAA , signed a 99-year lease for land in the Taipei Grand Hyatt Hotel at noontime , on which AIT plans to build a new office building .
Signing as witnesses in the ceremony were AIT Taipei Office Deputy Director David J. Keegan and CCNAA Deputy Director General Jacqueline Liu . Foreign Minister Mark Chen was also in attendance .
AIT was established by the Taiwan Relations Act to manage the unofficial relations of the United States with the people of Taiwan . It has offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung .
Douglas Paal said in a speech that it had been at least over ten years since AIT began to work with CCNAA and the Taipei city government to locate a plot of land for a new AIT facility .
He said that the current facility on Hsin Yi Road is a bit old and shabby-looking , and has literally run out of space .
For AIT , the transition from the current facility to the new office building will be a challenge . It will allow AIT to consolidate all of its operations , currently scattered throughout Taipei , into one centralized location and operate in a safe , secure , and modern environment .
He said that he design of the new building is underway and he hopes that the new facility will add beauty to Taiwan and become a source of pride for all of Taipei .
Once the design plan is completed , AIT will invite bids for a construction contract and construction will begin after the contractor has been decided . Construction is expected to begin within the next few years .
AIT spokesman Dana Smith said that the building is estimated to cost a total of around US $ 160 million to develop , including land rent and architectural design . Many factors must be taken into account on whether it can be completed by 2008 . He hopes construction work will start as soon as possible .
Thousands of Worshippers Head to Bethlehem for Christmas Midnight Mass
Thousands of worshippers are gathering in Bethlehem in the West Bank for the Christmas Midnight Mass .
Meanwhile , the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) ' s mainstream Fatah movement looks likely to defeat Hamas in yesterday 's Palestinian local election .
In violent conflicts , Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen were engaged in a gunfight in Gaza , leaving three Palestinian young men killed .
Israeli settlers blockaded a major road to protest a mortar attack on the settlement area .
PLO leader Abbas had also been allowed to go to the West Bank town of Bethlehem , which is the first time in the past four years Israeli authorities have allowed a senior Palestinian leader to attend Christmas celebrations .
Late PLO leader Arafat was a regular guest at Midnight Mass in Bethlehem after his return to the Palestinian territories in 1994 but he had been unable to attend since being confined to his headquarters in Ramallah by the Israeli army in early December 2001 .
The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Sabbah is set to begin his traditional procession shortly after midday today to Bethlehem 's Manger Square where thousands of Christians and Muslims have already been gathering .
Sabbah is scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at a Midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity .
Before the midday , Manger Square had been full of pilgrims with balloons of Santa Claus . They passed in and out of the Church of the Nativity . A Christmas tree outside of the church has been decorated with various lights and ornaments .
The Israeli authority has specially eased travel restrictions to enable Christians from the Gaza Strip , the West Bank and Israel to go to Bethlehem for the Midnight Mass .
Putin Claims Purchase of Major Assets of Yukos to Protect National Interest
Russian President Putin pointed out today that Russia 's takeover of the major assets of Russian oil giant Yukos was to protect the national interest . It was also the first move of re-nationalization in the post Soviet era .
Talking about the takeover by the Russian State Oil Company of Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company , Yukos ' subsidiary company , at a year-end press conference in the Kremlin , Putin said , " Russia is using an absolutely legitimate market mechanism to protect the national interest .
I think the move is absolutely normal . "
The Russian State Oil Company won the bid of Yuganskneftegaz 's Baikal Finance Group in a secret auction before the takeover and became the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company today .
The Russian State Oil Company made a sudden announcement just before last midnight that it had acquired 100 % ownership share of the previously little-known Baikal Finance Group .
The acquisition has enabled the Kremlin to take a firm grip on Russia 's crucial energy industry .
The Russian authority has been attacking Yukos and Khodorkovsky , its billionaire founder over the past 18 months .
The Russian State Oil Company is merging with the Russian State Gas Company . Altogether with Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company , the three will control 1 / 5 of Russia 's oil production and all its natural gas production to become the world 's largest energy group .
Putin has defended the purchase move by attacking the behind-the-scene privatization process of the 1990s .
The then privatization measures had enabled Russian economy 's most valuable assets to fall in hands of a small number of shrewd businessmen such as Khodorkovsky .
Baikal Finance Group previously offered $ 9.35 billion in a bid to win control of Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company .
Yushchenko Declares Himself Victor in Ukrainian Presidential Election
With preliminary election results showing opposition leader Yushchenko leading his rival , incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych , in the presidential revote , and Yushchenko having declared himself victor , supporters of Yushchenko held another gathering at the Independence Square today in the city center of Kiev to celebrate the victory .
" This is a clean political victory , " Fifty-year-old Yushchenko told the mass assembled at the square .
" This is an elegant victory . The people have demonstrated their power . The Ukrainian people have bravely risen up to resist what is probably the most unreasonable authority in Eastern European countries . Today , the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian people have won , " he said .
" For 14 years , we were independent , but we were not free , " he said .
" Today Ukraine has entered a new political era , " Yushchenko added .
" The era of ( outgoing President ) Kuchma , ( Kuchma 's predecessor ) Kravchuk , and ( incumbent Prime Minister ) Yanukovych has become history . "
According to the votes counted in over half of the constituencies released by Ukraine 's Central Election Commission , opposition leader Yushchenko has taken a 16-point lead over incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych in the historic presidential election re-voting .
Ukraine 's Central Election Commission says that the pro-West Yushchenko has won 56.33 % of the votes while the pro-Moscow Yanukovych has won 39.86 % .
The results are based on the polling results of 50.96 % of polling stations across Ukraine .
There are more than 33,000 polling stations in Ukraine .
An earlier exit poll also shows Yushchenko taking a 15 to 20-point lead over Yanukovych .
Japan 's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to Launch Telecommuting Trial to Reduce Office Life Pressures
Japan 's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications today launched an advanced Internet program , hoping that 20 % of the Japanese workforce could " telecommute " through the program before 2010 to reduce pressures from office life and resolve the problem of family splits .
An official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications says there are currently about 4 million Japanese , or 6 % of Japan 's total workforce of 63.2 million , working outside offices through scientific and technological means .
Starting from January , six officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will not need to enter the office for at least one day a week , instead using high-speed Internet service to perform their work duties from their homes , universities or libraries .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will expand the scope of the program based on feedbacks to increase the number of telecommuting employees working at home to 20 % of its 2,500-strong workforce .
A ministry official says the program , which enables employees to use chat rooms and teleconferencing , is expected to " improve workplace efficiency " .
He says telecommuting can offer employees more time to be with their family members and enable people supporting the family to do more housework .
He says the program can also ease the problems of traffic congestion , including a lessening of exhaust gas and less overcrowding of vehicles during rush hours .
He says the aim of the program is to " encourage the sharing of telecommuting technology with private firms " , to raise the ratio of telecommuters to 10 % by 2005 and 20 % by 2010 .
Pentagon Launches Unprecedented Relief Effort for Asian Tsunami Victims
The Pentagon said today that it had launched one of the largest relief operations in its history to help Asian Tsunami victims . The operation consists of two aircraft carrier strike groups , 20 reconnaissance and supply planes and tens of thousands of personnel .
Pentagon spokesman , Navy Major Hicks , said that after the tsunami of the 26th , which has killed over 80,000 people , the US military has been facing the challenge of launching operations in several regions at the same time .
" It is one of Pentagon 's largest humanitarian relief operations , " he told AFP .
Major General Conway , who is in charge of military operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said they are seeking to evaluate the scale of the disaster and have sent assessment teams to Thailand , Sri Lanka and Indonesia .
The Pentagon says it has dispatched 20 aircrafts to Southeast Asia , including six C-130 cargo aircrafts carrying drinking water and food , five KC-135 refueling aircrafts and nine P3 reconnaissance aircrafts .
The Pentagon has also mobilized the USS Lincoln and USS Richard aircraft carriers and their warships .
Conway says the USS Lincoln strike group and its 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel have departed Hong Kong for the Gulf of Thailand and will be deployed off Sumatra .
The USS Richard with 25 helicopters , 2,100 Marines and 1,400 crew aboard has left Guam and is expected to arrive in the Bay of Bengal on January 7th next year .
The Pentagon has decided to mobilize another 5 ships in Guam and 2 ships in the Indian Ocean base of Diego Garcia with freshwater-producing capability .
Conway says Thailand 's Utapao base in the Gulf of Thailand will serve as a command base for US military relief operations .
Nightclub Fire in Argentine Capital Kills At Least 169 Wounds 375
City officials in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires said today that at least 169 people had been killed and 375 injured in a fire at a Buenos Aires nightclub on the night of the 30th .
The nightclub was packed with some 2,000 teenagers celebrating the end of the academic year when the fire occurred .
The city 's Health Secretary Stein pointed out that the casualty toll was provisional .
" This is a disaster . This is a disaster , " Argentine Interior Minister Fernandez told reporters outside the smoldering nightclub , saying the death toll was provisional .
Stein pointed out that at least 375 people were injured in the blaze , including 18 police officers .
Stein said the fire broke out before midnight on the 30th at this disco club in the city center , where some 2,000 youngsters were attending a rock concert inside the ballroom .
Buenos Aires Mayor Ibarra said that according to unconfirmed reports , the blaze started when somebody tossed a flare during the concert .
" This is a terrible night , " Ibarra told Todo Noticias television .
Bodies were lined up on the street as firefighters attempted to put out the blaze .
A chaotic scene unfolded outside the blazing discotheque early today , as hundreds of police and firefighters mingled with stunned teenagers and their parents searching frantically for their children .
UN : Relief Materials Could Take Weeks to Reach Tsunami Victims in Aceh
The United Nations said today that desperately needed relief supplies would take " weeks " to reach tsunami survivors in isolated areas of Indonesia 's Aceh Province .
US Navy helicopters arrived in Banda Aceh , the capital of Aceh Province , while more and more field hospitals were being put into operation in the city . An enormous amount of relief supplies have been arriving at the airport in succession .
But the chief of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia , Elmquist , told reporters that a myriad of coordination and infrastructure problems was making it impossible to quickly deliver aid .
" It 's going to take weeks before we send relief materials to all the isolated areas , " Elmquist told reporters by telephone from the capital Jakarta after returning from Banda Aceh .
" It 's a concern and we are desperately doing what we can to find ways of establishing distribution systems in Banda Aceh , " he said
The UN and other relief organizations have warned that people in the devastated region of Indonesia 's Sumatra may die within days if they do not have immediate access to clean water , food and medical treatment .
Asked if the delay was effectively a death sentence for some tsunami survivors , Elmquist replied , " I hope not . I hope that people are finding ways to get food and water , but obviously it 's not a situation we are happy about . "
" It 's a very serious situation and we can only hope that it 's possible to do something quicker , " he said .
Japan Offers US $ 500m for Relief , Topping World in Funds
Japan today promised US $ 500 million to countries devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunamis . Japan 's contribution by far outpledges all the other countries racing to help victims of one of the world 's worst disasters , increasing the money the world has promised for relief and reconstruction to more than US $ 1.6 billion .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said in a statement that as Asia 's largest economy , Japan would consider more assistance including money and technology .
" Japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways : financial resources , knowledge and expertise , and human resources , " he said .
" For the time being , Japan will extend to affected countries and relevant international organizations up to US $ 500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the disaster , " he said .
Koizumi also said he would take part in a meeting of world leaders on the 6th in the Indonesian capital Jakarta to discuss aid for the tsunami-hit countries .
The US government increased its promised aid nearly ten-fold to US $ 350 million yesterday after US President Bush was accused of being slow to respond to the massive human disaster .
China , which is seen as increasingly challenging Japan for influence in Asia , has promised US $ 60.5 million , a major sum for a developing nation .
" Japan will make further contributions by utilizing fire-department helicopters and personnel , " Koizumi said .
" Japan will also consider , as early as possible , additional contributions including mobilizing Japan 's Self Defense Forces ' aircrafts , vessels and personnel . "
Japan had earlier pledged US $ 30 million to the tsunami-hit countries .
A foreign ministry spokesman said that the amount was included in Koizumi 's 500 million dollar pledge .
WHO : 50 Aid Groups to Offer Medical Assistance in Indonesia 's Aceh Province
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said today that 50 aid groups had arrived in Indonesia 's Aceh Province to provide medical care for survivors of the tsunami disaster .
The WHO 's Indonesian representative , Petersen , said the WHO was trying to coordinate all the groups and had held a meeting with them in the afternoon .
Petersen said coordination was proving difficult because many groups had gone directly into Aceh for relief work .
" We are trying to sort it out , everyone has just come in , but everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate , " Petersen said by telephone from Jakarta .
Petersen reiterated that the WHO 's main concern was to prevent the outbreak of diseases such as cholera and dysentery , which have the potential to kill tens of thousands of people .
" We are very worried since we have a very large number of people displaced who don 't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies , " Petersen said .
" So we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks . "
However , Petersen stressed that there has been no sign yet of any major problems with the diseases .
Indonesia 's Health Ministry says up to 100,000 people in Sumatra may have been killed in the tsunami disaster , with most of the victims in Aceh Province .
As most of the medical facilities have been destroyed in Aceh Province , the Indonesian military and the governments of Singapore and Australia have set up at least 8 field hospitals in the past week . The United Nations Children 's Fund has also begun delivering basic medical kits intended to help 200,000 children .
Powell Predicts Shiite Victory in Iraqi Election
US Secretary of State Colin Powell today predicted a Shiite victory in the Iraqi elections but he also assuaged concerns it could bolster Iranian influence inside the country because of the past feud between Iraqi and Iranian Shias .
There are growing indications that Sunni Arabs will either boycott the January 30th election or will be prevented from taking part in it by the Iraqi authority due to a spreading insurgency .
" The new government and the transitional national assembly that will come into place will be majority Shiite , " said Powell on NBC 's " Meet the Press " .
" The majority of the Iraqi population is also Shiite . "
Shiite Muslims make up more than 60 % of Iraq 's population , and are concentrated mostly in the southern and central parts of the country .
Sunni Arabs , who live in central and western provinces , comprise about 20 % of all Iraqis .
Former Iraqi Foreign Minister Pachachi , who now heads the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Independent Democrats Party , today called for the vote to be delayed but Powell said the Iraqi election would be held on schedule .
Powell also said he felt it was unlikely Shiite control of Iraq 's future government would mean it would be run from Iran .
" My sensing right now is that , even though there may be Iranian influence - and Iranians will try to influence Iraq 's political situation , but there is sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between Iranian and Iraqi Shias , " he said .
International Aid Pours in But Time Not on Tsunami Victims ' Side
Foreign rescue troops are airdropping food and setting up clean water supplies in Asia 's tsunami-hit areas to help millions of victims left homeless and hungry .
Statistics show the death toll has reached nearly 150,000 .
Donations are flooding in from various governments while US President Bush has put his father , George Bush , and his predecessor , Clinton , in charge of efforts to raise private aid .
A US delegation led by Secretary of State Powell arrived in Thailand last night to express US concern and assess the progress of the relief work ahead of a crisis summit on the 6th in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta .
Powell 's delegation includes President Bush 's younger brother , Florida Governor Jeb Bush , and US Agency for International Development administrator Natsios .
Powell will head the delegation to inspect the disaster in Thailand , Indonesia and Sri Lanka before attending the summit on the 6th .
Powell said the mission of the visit was to assess the situation " and see what else the US might need to do " , but he was carrying no new immediate promise of aid beyond the 350 million dollars already committed .
Since the disaster occurred , there is a voice now to give up the search for thousands of tourists still unaccounted for , many of them foreign tourists .
However , Thai Prime Minister Thaksin has vowed that the hunt will go on in his country .
" We will continue to use our best efforts as foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . So we will not stop searching , " Thaksin told reporters in Phuket Island .
An unprecedented international relief effort is underway .
A fleet of US navy helicopters from the US aircraft carrier Lincoln dropped aid and picked up survivors for a second day in Aceh of Indonesia .
Rear Admiral Crowder , commander of the Lincoln , says that 50,000 pounds of food and water have so far been delivered to the disaster-hit areas and the operation is " going great " .
Tsunami Relief Efforts Mask Backstage Political Wrestling
With Asian tsunami relief materials flooding into disaster-hit areas , behind-the-scene activities are also underway with governments wrestling over who should offer and receive the aid and who should play a leading role in the largest relief operation in modern history .
The tragedy , which has killed nearly 150,000 people , has rekindled past flames of war , including the differences between the United States , the United Nations and Europe as well as the struggle for the leading role in Asia .
However , relief experts still hold cautious hopes that given the many countries that have been hit by the tsunami , the tragedy on a global scale may set a precedent for countries that have promised aid to indeed keep their commitments .
" Aid commitments by governments have never been 100 % fulfilled in time , " said International development Professor Juma of Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government .
Governments have already pledged aid of US $ 2 billion . Prominent figures in the international political arena including US Secretary of State Powell and UN Secretary General Annan as well as the leaders of Australia , China and Japan will hold a crisis summit with deep political implications on the 6th in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta .
US President Bush increased US aid nearly ten-fold to US $ 350 million after being accused of being slow in response and following senior UN relief official Egeland 's open criticism of rich countries ' " stinginess " .
In Asia , the tsunami has resulted in a behind-the-scene wrestle over regional influence . Increasingly confident China has promised to offer aid worth US $ 60.5 million , a major sum for a developing nation .
Japan , which has been reducing its foreign aid for six consecutive years , has shattered remarks that the country 's power is declining with rapid action ; promising to provide at least US $ 500 million , a sum which far outshines other nations .
World Leaders Tour Sri Lanka to Assess Tsunami Damage
Sri Lankan officials say that world leaders including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell are successively arriving in Sri Lanka to gain a first-hand view of the tsunami damage that killed 30,600 people here last month .
They say Powell has already arrived and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan is due around noon .
The US embassy said in a statement that Powell is to visit some of the areas worst hit by the December 26 tsunami , including the southern region of Galle where US marines are to be based for relief operations .
The South Korean embassy said in a statement that Lee Hae-Chan would tour the west coast accompanied by the Sri Lankan Prime Minister .
" Together with Sri Lanka 's Prime Minister Rajapakse , the Korean Prime Minister will travel along the western coast to have a firsthand view of the destruction of lives , livelihoods and property caused by the tsunami , " the statement said .
Lee Hae-Chan will stop over in Hambantota , the worst affected area , to oversee relief operations being carried out by private and non-governmental organizations from South Korea .
UN Secretary General Annan is expected to start a two-day visit in the evening .
" He will be touring along with World Bank president Wolfhensohn to some of the affected regions in the south and the east , " said UN spokesman Samarsinghe .
World Health Organization Director General Lee Jong-Wook will also arrive in Colombo today .
German Foreign Minister Fischer is due in Sri Lanka by the weekend .
Sri Lankan officials say many other world leaders are expected to come over the next few weeks .
These leaders include Canadian Prime Minister Martin . Canada announced yesterday that Martin would visit Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month .
Bush : US Set to Boost Peace Efforts after Palestinian Election
US President Bush said today he was " deeply heartened " by a strong turnout in today 's Palestinian elections and promised that the US would bolster its peace efforts .
" Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza took a key step toward building a democratic future by electing a new chairman of the self-rule government , " President Bush said in a statement .
" Observers of the election have described the election as free and fair . "
" This is a historic day for the Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East , " he said .
Exit polls show former Prime Minister Abbas has won the election by a huge margin , winning two-thirds of the votes cast .
He will succeed Arafat as chairman of the Palestinian self-rule government .
" These efforts , including today 's presidential elections and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months , are essential for the establishment of a sovereign , independent , democratic and peaceful Palestinian state , a new state that can ensure the security of Israel , " Bush said
He said the US government looked forward to cooperating with the newly elected Palestinian self-rule government chairman and the Palestinian people to advance the cause of Middle East peace .
Peace in the Middle East is consistent with the wishes of the peoples of both Israel and Palestine for peaceful and secure coexistence .
Bush has also urged Israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza .
He added that Arab states must " jointly take concrete steps with all concerned parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , offer financial support to the Palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists " .
Annan 's Plan to Visit Rebel Controlled Regions in Sri Lanka Blocked
UN Secretary General Annan said today he wanted to return to Sri Lanka someday to " see all parts of the country " .
Annan ended a two-day tour of tsunami-battered parts of Sri Lanka amid reports the Sri Lankan government had blocked him from visiting rebel-held northern areas .
Asked at a press conference whether the Sri Lankan government had blocked him from traveling to zones held by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , as widely reported in several national newspapers , Annan said , " I 'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process . "
Annan said President Kumaratunga had personally objected to his on-site visit in guerrilla-held territory , fearing the rebels would make political capital out of his visit .
" I raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the peace efforts , " he said .
" I have also discussed that with President Kumaratunga . "
The abandoned visit of Annan to rebel-held regions has resulted in the indignation of residents of the rebel-controlled northern city of Jaffna . Hundreds of people staged a protest outside the UN office in Jaffna .
However , the Sri Lankan government has firmly rejected the media reports , saying they are " misleading . "
On the other hand , as the relief work is in its full swing , Sri Lanka 's weather forecasting authority has warned that Sri Lanka 's costal lines are likely to be hit by a Typhoon currently being formed in coastal waters .
Russian Space Agency Denies Rocket Fuel Causes Sickness among Children
The British weekly science journal Nature reports that highly toxic rocket fuel , spewed out during launches of spacecrafts at Russia 's space base in Baikonur , Kazakhstan , is causing serious illness among children living nearby . But the Russian Space Agency has denied the claim today .
The science journal Nature report published today quotes a study as saying that levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents in the polluted areas are twice the regional average .
The study was conducted by a team of Russian scientists led by epidemiologist Zykov .
The Russian Space Agency responded by saying that " no direct influence of space-related activities on the population 's health has so far been established " .
The study quoted by Nature focused on children in the Altai Republic .
The Altai Republic is located in a mountainous region on the southern fringes of Siberia .
The Altai Republic was chosen as the study 's target because of pollution from unburned fuel , notably hydrazine .
Hydrazine is used to power the early stages of some Russian launchers .
Zykov compared the health records of about 1,000 children in two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with health records of 3,300 children from a nearby unpolluted control group .
Nature reports Zykov has concluded that children in the currently worst-affected areas are up to twice as likely to need medical attention during this time , and need to be treated twice as long .
White House Says Iraqi Election Will Be Flawed
The White House acknowledged today that Iraqi elections set for January 30th are " not going to be perfect " . Meanwhile , two car bombings in Iraq 's Mosul today killed at least two Iraqi soldiers .
Asked if he agreed with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi ' s statement that violence would make voting impossible in some areas of Iraq , White House spokesman McClellan said , " We all recognize that the election is not going to be perfect . "
" This is the first time Iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders . It 's for a transitional government , and it 's one of three elections that will take place this year , " he said .
" So we 're going to do everything we can to help the Iraqi people and the interim government to ensure as broad a participation as possible in this upcoming election , " McClellan said .
A bloody insurgency erupted in Iraq on the 11th , which caused the deaths of at least 25 people with 6 killed in a car bombing attack in former President Hussein 's hometown of Tikrit . As a result , Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi acknowledged that some parts of Iraq would not be able to take part in this month 's election .
Meanwhile , two more bombing attacks occurred in the Iraq city of Mosul today , killing at least two Iraqi soldiers .
US army Sergeant Schaeffer told AFP that a truck exploded when trying to attack a joint convoy of US and Iraqi military vehicles , killing an unknown number of civilians .
Schaeffer said a second car parked on the other side of the street exploded and killed two Iraqi soldiers .
US Trade Deficit Reaches Record High of US $ 60 Billion in November
The US Commerce Department announced today that US exports sank 2.3 % last November , driving the trade deficit to a record high of US $ 60.3 billion .
US exports fell to a five-month low of US $ 95.6 billion while US imports rose 1.3 % to a record US $ 155.8 billion as the orders for imported oil increased over 2 billion dollars , up 1.3 % , to a record US $ 14.2 billion .
The trade gap rose 7.7 % from last October 's revised US $ 56 billion and a huge 50.8 % from November 2003 's US $ 40 billion .
According to a survey conducted by CBS ' MarketWatch , Wall Street economists had expected the trade deficit on goods and services to shrink to around US $ 53.3 billion .
The US trade deficit is still growing despite a weakening dollar , which has made US goods cheaper at home and abroad .
Today 's report from the Commerce Department will put pressure on the dollar and renew calls for Washington to do something about US energy independence and the trade imbalance between the US and China .
The decline of US exports last November was caused by a US $ 1.4-billion drop in capital goods , including US $ 325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines .
Exports of industrial materials , mainly energy , fell by US $ 800 million .
Exports of autos , consumer goods and food also declined .
Japanese Defense Chief : Never Forget Militaristic History , Respect Neighboring Nations ' Dignity
The Director General of Japan 's Defense Agency , Yoshinori Ono , said today that even with Japan 's high profile in the world , it would not forget its militarist history and would keep in mind neighboring Asian countries ' " dignity " .
Asked about concerns likely to rise upon Japan sending its Self Defense Forces ( SDF ) to the tsunami-hit areas of South Asia , Ono said , " When we have contacts with Southeast Asian countries , we should never forget the past . "
He told reporters , " We must establish a kind of relationship whereby we can tell our friendly neighbors that we are friendly .
When looking back at the past , we should fully respect other countries ' dignity . "
Ono specifically talked about this year as marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War . " We hope we can be reborn and cooperate with the new era , " he said .
Ono has just concluded a tour of several tsunami-hit South Asian countries . He said that when the Indonesian leader told him that the relief operation by Japan 's SDF should come to an end no later than the end of March , he felt the " dignity " of an independent nation .
The UN has expressed its concern over the time limit for foreign troops set by the Indonesian government .
Foreign troops have been widely praised for offering aid to the most remote tsunami survivors .
Nearly 1,000 Japanese SDF soldiers are heading to countries that were hit by the tsunami on December 26th . The death toll of the disaster has exceeded 163,000 .
This is the largest deployment operation of Japan 's SDF since the end of the Second World War .
Japan 's constitution imposed by the United States after the war renounces the use of force by the SDF .
Political Interference in NHK Program ? War of Words Erupts in Japanese Media
Allegations that the public-owned Japan Broadcasting Corp. ( NHK ) had been pressured by politicians several years ago to soft-pedal a program on Japan 's legacy of sexual enslavement during World War II have pitted liberal Japanese media against their conservative counterparts .
Liberal Japanese media have attacked NHK for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of Japan 's wartime conduct and victims of sex slavery , allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders .
But conservative newspapers have defended NHK 's editing of the program , saying that NHK executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objectiveness of their programs .
The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex slavery of comfort women in the Japanese military during the war .
The trial , held by a women 's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000 , found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women during Japan 's occupation of Asian nations .
Historians say at least 200,000 young women , mostly Korean but also from Taiwan , China , the Philippines and Indonesia , were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese army brothels during the war .
The program 's chief producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful news conference on the 13th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior NHK officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party , Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa , who expressed concerns over the program .
Nagai said top NHK officials then re-edited and shortened the program .
" NHK bowed to political pressure , " he said .
Abe and Nakagawa admitted meeting with NHK officials and telling them to be " fair " but strongly denied pressuring the broadcaster .
Eurozone Indicators Show Core Inflation under Control
Economists said today that Eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation still remains under control .
Meanwhile , Eurozone industrial output and French consumer spending are both expected to decline .
When the European Union 's statistics service releases inflation figures on the 20th this month , they are expected to confirm that inflation will rise slightly to 2.3 % in December from 2.2 % in November .
But the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 % .
Core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer prices figures .
Economists point out that core inflation , which excludes food , energy , tobacco and alcohol prices , has remained at a 1.6-2 % range for the past two years .
European Central Bank President Trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have diminished recently .
While inflation will remain above 2 % in the coming months , it is likely to fall below this level by the end of the year .
Meanwhile , another economist says a weak number is expected to be released for the Eurozone 's November industrial output on the 18th , given recent evidence of weak growth in Germany .
German output declined 1.7 % in November and economists polled by AFP 's financial news subsidiary AFX News expect Eurozone output to fall 0.4 % in November following the 0.5 % drop recorded in October .
Schmieding of the Bank of America says a rebound in Eurozone output is likely in December .
Bureaucracy Hits Tsunami Refugees Twice
Three weeks after the strongest tsunami in history , surviving refugees are fighting with bureaucracy and political domination while the world 's attention has already been distracted to other places .
With thousands of decaying corpses gradually unearthed from the rubble , the death toll of the December 26th tsunami disaster has exceeded 168,000 . Meanwhile , the upcoming Iraqi election and President Bush 's inauguration will replace the tsunami disaster to become the world media 's headline news .
Indonesia has backtracked on a demand that foreign troops engaged in humanitarian relief operations will withdraw within 3 months .
In Thailand , leaders of Canada , Sweden , Norway and Finland are discussing the reconstruction project and efforts to identify the dead .
However , survivors are facing new difficulties . For instance , the deep-rooted bureaucracy in Indonesia has hindered the delivery of relief materials pouring in from around the world .
" We are like persons who do not exist . We have been hit hard by the disaster , lost everything and are famished , " said Busriadi , a fisherman from a little fishing village in Aceh Province 's capital , Banda Aceh , on Indonesia 's Sumatra Island .
he asked , " Where are the food , clothes and other relief pouring into Aceh as we have seen on television ? "
Busriadi , like thousands of other refugees , lost his identity cards and other official documents in the tsunami , making his quest for aid a nightmare .
Despite begging officials for help and daily hurrying back and forth going through formalities , the results have always been the same : no aid .
Zeng Qinghong Reportedly Paid Visit to Zhao Ziyang Before the Latter 's Death
The Hong Kong-based China Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy says Vice President Zeng Qinghong paid a visit to Zhao Ziyang , the purged former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , before he died early this morning in a hospital .
The Information Center has cited Zhao Ziyang 's family members as saying Zeng Qinghong visited him at 6 : 00am in a Beijing hospital , about one hour before he died at the age of 85 .
Zhao Ziyang served as CPC General Secretary and Premier , but was ousted for opposing the use of military force to suppress the 1989 democratic movement at Tiananmen Square . He has since been under house arrest and regarded as an unpopular figure by the government .
The Information Center has cited Zhao 's family members as saying the incumbent Premier Wen Jiabao , who used to work for Zhao Ziyang , had not paid a visit to him when he was seriously ill .
However , before Zhao Ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th , Tian Jiyun , a retired member of the CPC Central Committee and his former assistant , visited him .
The China Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy has been in contact with Zhao 's family and for years has been releasing accurate news about Zhao Ziyang at appropriate time .
The Information Center said some 20 retired senior party , government and military officials planned to write an open letter to the CPC , calling for a reappraisal of Zhao Ziyang 's contributions and an open memorial service for him .
The Information Center also said that Zhao Ziyang 's family will not be allowed to hold or prepare for a funeral , and relevant arrangements will be finally decided by the Party .
Zhao Ziyang 's wife , Liang Boqi , is 86 now .
The Information Center said that due to concerns about her health , she had still not been informed about her husband 's death as of this evening .
Zhao Ziyang Passes Away , China Urged to Move Toward Democratization
After the former leader of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , Zhao Ziyang , died of illness today , world figures have highly praised him while Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , the Taiwan government and overseas democratic movement activists have all called on Beijing to carry out Zhao Ziyang 's ideas of democratic reform .
Zhao Ziyang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at Tiananmen Square . He was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85 .
Jiji Press reported Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi as saying , while mourning for Zhao Ziyang , that , " I hope they ( China ) are committed to democratization . б▒
Taiwan has also appealed to China to carry out political and democratic reform after Zhao Ziyang 's death .
Chinese overseas democracy movement activists have praised Zhao Ziyang as " one of China 's greatest reformers " , who sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square .
" During his suffering under house arrest for 15 years , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards a government of law and democracy , " said Lian Shengde , once a student movement leader and now President of the New York-based Free China Movement .
" Zhao Ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle . "
Some democracy movement activists have requested the Chinese government hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and give fair appraisal to his achievements .
However , they have acknowledged that Zhao Ziyang will not be offered such courteous service , as the Chinese government fears that people who are disgruntled with the Communist rule will make use of this opportunity to make disturbances .
The 1989 student democratic movement was prompted just by the death of reformist Party leader Hu Yaobang .
Xinhua News Agency reported briefly today that Comrade Zhao Ziyang died in Beijing due to illness , which was the only official announcement on the matter .
UN : Rich Countries Fail to Fulfill Commitment to Reduce Poor Population
A UN appointed expert panel says in a new report that rich countries have so far failed to fulfill their commitments when they promised to offer aid to reduce half of the world 's extremely poor population by 2015 .
The world 's rich countries had promised to take part in the ambitious UN " New Millennium Development Goal " program in order to improve the fate of the world 's poor and suffering .
However , over 1 billion people in the world live on less than one US dollar and some 2.7 billion people live on less than two US dollars every day . UN experts say there is almost no time left for rich countries to fulfill their commitments .
" With the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reform in developing as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achievable , " said Brown , head of the UN Development Program .
UN experts say the world 's 22 rich nations have promised to offer 0.7 % of their Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) to aid developing countries but they are now providing only 0.25 % .
UN Secretary General Annan has commissioned former Harvard economist Sachs to lead a team of development experts to prepare this report on the progress of the goals , which includes extreme poverty elimination , achieving universal elementary education , child mortality reduction and the fight against AIDS and other deadly diseases .
" In fact , the ways to practically resolve the problems already exist , the political structures have been set up and the costs are affordable for the first time . What is needed now is action , " the report says .
UN Announces Establishment of Global Disaster Warning System
The United Nations has announced it will set up a global disaster warning system to predict large natural disasters .
However , differences remain over which country 's technology will be used in the disaster warning system in the wake of the South Asian tsunami tragedy .
Several UN agencies said in a joint statement after a global conference in Kobe , Japan , that UN experts would create a global disaster system to reduce the damage resulting from large natural disasters .
The large disaster caused by the South Asian tsunami has outraged Indian Ocean nations .
" The new program will bring peace and security to mankind , " said Briceno , Director of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction .
" An effective early warning system can protect the lives and safety of millions of people around the world . "
But the UN statement is largely symbolic .
Officials of the UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) say more important discussions will be held on the disaster warning system .
The UNESCO is leading the effort to set up a global disaster warning system .
" Several countries have raised their proposals now so we need to do the work of coordination , " said Bernal , head of UNESCO 's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission .
Bernal says the Commission will hold two meetings within 60 days , in hopes of picking one of the countries ' tsunami warning systems .
One meeting will be held in Paris and the other has yet to be determined .
Bernal hopes that a decision can be finalized in July . The global disaster warning system will be completed and be running by mid-2006 , which is also the target date set by the UNESCO .

Shanghai Tops World in Power Generation Equipment Output and Capacity
Xinhua News Agency report of December 1st from Shanghai ( by staff reporter Jiang Wei ) - Following the test run of a 660-MW power generation unit , Shanghai Steam Turbine Generator Co . , Ltd attached to the Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group on the 1st reached its target for an annual production of power generation units with a total capacity of 15,000 MW ahead of schedule . This enables Shanghai to top the world in terms of both the production of power station equipment and production capacity , thus fulfilling the long-cherished wishes of several generations of people working in China 's equipment manufacturing sector .
Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group is China 's largest power station equipment manufacturing base .
Over the past several years , due to the rapidly rising demand for power generation equipment in China , power generator manufacturers entered a stage of high growth and great development .
Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group has combined its advantageous reserve of turbine generator and power station boiler equipment to win via public bidding the order for manufacturing nine units of heavy-duty gas turbine generators and 3 exhaust heat boilers after contracting for four 1000-MW thermal power generation units .
Meanwhile , the integration of operations has further improved the firm 's management , technological development and production efficiency .
Currently , Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group holds a 40 % market share in China 's power station equipment sector and is continuing to expand its overseas markets in regions such as the Middle East , Southeast Asia and South America .
In this year alone , Shanghai Steam Turbine Company has won contracts for power generator 's main engine parts worth 6 billion Yuan .
The President of Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group , Zheng Jianhua said that this summer 's " power shortage " had resulted in sharply rising demand for power station equipment and that the power station equipment market had seen increasingly fierce competition .
The group is working towards the three big targets of " developing 1000-MW thermal power generating units and gas turbine-generating units as well as 1000-MW nuclear power generating units " so as to become one of the world 's Top 500 at an early date .
( Hong Kong , Macao and Taiwan ) Hong Kong Observatory Offers New Services to World Meteorological Organization 's Websites
Xinhua News Agency report of December 2nd from Hong Kong - Starting on the 2nd , the Hong Kong Observatory ( HKO ) will offer two new services to the World Meteorological Organization 's websites , the " World Weather Information Service " and the " Severe Weather Information Center " .
A spokesman for the observatory says the two services will offer official weather observations of global cloud cover and rainfall to the " World Weather Information Service " website and a 7-day review of tropical cyclone movement to the " Severe Weather Information Center " website .
The two services follow HKO 's provision of official observation data on worldwide heavy rain ( including heavy snow ) which was offered to the " Severe Weather Information Center " website at the beginning of the year .
Sources say the " World Weather Information Service " website has been offering official weather forecasts and monthly average climatological data for major cities around the world .
The new service offers official weather observations around the world for the first time , with maps of global cloud cover and rainfall as its primary service items .
The new web pages will cover a wide range of detailed weather observation data with 8 regular updates each day .
The new product for the " Severe Weather Information Center " website is a review function of tropical cyclone movement routes .
It was so designed originally that the website would not keep such information as a tropical cyclone 's previous locations after it had disappeared .
However , it has often been the case that the public still want to obtain the relevant data about the tropical cyclone several days after its landing .
To serve this purpose , the new product saves the tropical cyclone 's grades , locations and movement routes for the past 7 days so that the public and the media could still obtain needed data about a tropical cyclone several days after its landing and disappearance .
World 's First Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Rapid Diagnostic Kits Successfully Developed in Shantou
Xinhua News Agency report of December 3rd from Shantou ( by staff reporters Zhang Yiwen and Lin Junqiang ) - Sources from the Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong 's Joint Influenza Research Center say that they have developed the world 's first bird flu virus H5N1 rapid diagnostic kits after six months of cooperation with Xiamen University .
The rapid diagnostic kits can detect bird flu infections in a suspect 's sample as fast as within one hour .
Professor Guan Yi , Director of the Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong 's Joint Influenza Research Center , says that current data shows that the death rate of the deadly infectious bird flu virus is much higher than that of the SARS virus .
Previous tests used to take three to five days to ascertain infection and sometimes more than a week .
The successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technology employs the methods of ELISA and Gold Agglutination tests to examine such samples as nasal or throat secretions and chicken embryo culture for whole or split viruses and blood serum to confirm any infection with the bird flu virus as quickly as within 1 hour or no more than 2 hours .
The new technique is simple , convenient , and easy to apply on the spot in epidemic-stricken areas . It is 90 % accurate and helpful for early discovery , diagnosis , isolation and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent the wide spread of the epidemic and large-scale disaster .
Upon the invitation of the China Disease Prevention and Control Center , Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong 's Joint Influenza Research Center recently held a training course on bird flu diagnostic techniques , including the latest bird flu rapid diagnostic technique , for personnel from the disease prevention and control centers of 20 provinces and cities across the country .
Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Commission in Hong Kong Expresses Strong Displeasure with Remarks by Hyde , Chairman of the US House International Relations Committee
Xinhua News Agency report of December 3rd from Hong Kong - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Commission in Hong Kong expressed strong displeasure on the 3rd with recent remarks made by Hyde , Chairman of the International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives , in Hong Kong .
The spokesman said the speech in Hong Kong on the 2nd by Mr. Hyde , Chairman of the US House of Representatives ' International Relations Committee , was a malicious attack on China 's development and progress as well as a slander on China 's foreign policy evidencing a cold war mentality , with which we are strongly unsatisfied .
The spokesman noted that it is known to all the world that China 's development is not only in the fundamental interests of the 1.3 billion Chinese people but also beneficial to the world 's prosperity and development .
In the international political arena , China is a responsible country and has been playing an active and constructive role in safeguarding the world 's peace and stability .
On the issue of nuclear non-proliferation , China has always strictly abided by relevant international conventions , firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form , and insisted on solving such issues through negotiations , talks and the strengthening of international supervision .
The spokesman points out that it is regrettable that Mr. Hyde has turned a blind eye to the facts and made such extremely irresponsible remarks as Sino-US relations are witnessing a healthy and stable development , which completely runs counter to the common grounds on the development of bilateral ties reached recently by heads of states of China and the US , goes against the mainstream voice in US asking to strengthen the cooperative relations with China , and is certainly harmful to the development of Sino-US relations .
China 's Largest Seawater Desalination Project to Be Kicked off in Zhoushan
Xinhua News Agency report of December 6th from Hangzhou ( by Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun ) - China 's largest seawater desalination project in the mainland so far , with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons , is to be kicked off in the Putuo District of Zhoushan city in Zhejiang Province .
For residents in Zhoushan long accustomed to water shortages , the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes .
According to relevant authorities , a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and the Liuheng Township government of Zhoushan city .
The project costs 50 million Yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water . It is presently the largest seawater desalination project in the mainland . The first-stage of construction is expected to be completed next year .
Zhoushan is one of Chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage .
The entire city consists of 1,390 islands . The per capita fresh water is 601 cubic meters , which equals to only 25.4 % of the per capita average in Zhejiang Province . The problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city .
Taking Liuheng Township in Putuo District as an example , some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 Yuan per ton .
The technique of seawater desalination by reverse osmosis , developed by the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration , is a process of membrane separation through the driving force of pressure , which at present is a focal point for current global seawater desalination research .
According to the persons in charge from the center , both the cost and the energy consumption level of the seawater desalination by reverse osmosis project have been lowered through technological improvement and equipment modifications at home .
The cost of seawater desalination per ton has further been lowered from the original 5 Yuan .
This indicates that the cost of seawater desalination is expected to approach that of tap water and industrial water .
( International ) Results of Hungarian Referendum on the 5th Invalidated
Xinhua News Agency report of December 5th from Budapest ( by staff reporter Liu Weimin ) - A national referendum was held on the 5th in Hungary on issues regarding the privatization of the country 's hospitals and public health-care institutions and the granting of dual citizenship to ethnic Hungarians living outside the country .

Under Hungary 's relevant laws , a referendum result is valid only if the number of people taking part in the vote is more than 50 % of the total number of voters across the nation or if the number of votes for or against the above questions exceed 25 % of the total number of voters across the nation .
Before the vote , the Hungarian government and the ruling party had been calling on voters to vote against the two questions while opposition parties called on voters to support them .
Sources say that voter turnout for this referendum was the lowest ever , counting both referendums and elections .
Following the release of the polling results , Hungarian Prime Minister Gyurcsany made a speech recognizing the failure of the referendum .
He said that the government would take more active steps to draw up policies towards nationalities and carry out health care reform .
The chairman of Hungary 's largest opposition party , the Alliance of Young Democrats , Orban , said that although the voters did not reach the required number , the referendum was helpful nevertheless .

Three Gorges Project 's Underground Powerhouse to Begin Construction
Xinhua News Agency report of December 8th from Wuhan ( by staff reporter Shi Yongfeng ) - The principal part of the underground powerhouse of the Three Gorges Project began inviting bids for the first time on December 8th , which preludes the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant .
The Three Gorges Project design calls for installation of 26 700-MW water turbo generator units with an installation capacity of 18,200 MW . After their full operation , the units will generate an annual average of 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours .
To further tap its power generation potential , the Three Gorges Project has reserved a location for the construction of an underground power station in its preliminary design .
According to the chief from the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation , the Three Gorges underground power station is located in mountains to the right side of the Three Gorges Dam . Major structures include an intake tower , diversion canal , main plant buildings , tailrace systems , bus shafts , and a 500-KV transformer substation .
Six 700-MW power generation units will be installed in the underground power station .
As a result , the total number of generating units in Three Gorges Project will increase from 26 to 32 and the installed capacity will increase from 18,200 MW to 22,400 MW , dramatically improving the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project .
Flood prevention is a top priority in the construction of the Three Gorges Project .
According to the operation and control plan of the Three Gorges Reservoir , the water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir will need to be lowered from its normal level of 175 meters to the flood prevention level of 145 meters before the start of flooding season each year .
As a result , the construction of the underground power station will raise the water exploitation index of the Three Gorges Reservoir , reducing abandonment of water , increasing power generation capacity and maximizing the station 's non-flood peak adjustment period when abandonment of water is not necessary .
At present , the preparatory projects such as the excavation and construction work of the underground power station 's tributary canals , tailrace canals and supporting structures have already begun .
Sources say the underground power station will be fully completed and operational at the end of 2008 .

Experts Propose Introducing News Spokesman System for Minors in China
Xinhua News Agency report of December 13th from Shanghai ( by reporter Liu Dan ) - " The China Youth Social Education Forum --- 2004 Media and the Development of Minors " , which ended on the 13th in Shanghai , has proposed that China should introduce a spokesman system in respect of the status of minors to regularly release news on the current development and existing problems of minors .
A recent poll conducted by the relevant organizations in Shanghai showed that minors spend an average of 1.17 , 1.05 and 0.99 hours each day on extracurricular books , TV and the Internet . About half of their after-school time is spent on the media , which , as a brand-new social force , has become a factor that can 't be neglected in minors ' growth and development .
" Media is a window that connects the youths hearts and the outside world . When the window is opened , fresh air comes in . So do flies and mosquitoes " ,
Chen Tianqiao , President , Shanghai ShanDa Networking ( Group ) Co . , Ltd. said .
While the media may offer beneficial conditions for the healthy development of minors , due to the needs of market competition and economic benefits as well as a lack of quality with some media people , the viewpoints in published articles may easily mislead minors in their thinking and values . Even worse is the dissemination of violence and pornography in some media .
At present , there are more than 2,000 TV channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies with 1,868 radio programs . The number of domestic Internet users has reached 87 million .
Officials of the forum say that the establishment of a spokesman system for minors will offer authoritative investigation data on the current development and problems of young people and change the current " false voices " of the media to create a healthy and favorable environment of public opinions for minors ' development .

( International ) UN Warns of Rise in Global Drug-Related Deaths in 2005
Xinhua New Agency report of December 17th from Vienna ( by staff reporter Song Guocheng ) - The Executive Director of the UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention , Costa , warned in a press statement on the 17th that due to the production increase of Heroin in Afghanistan , the world 's black market price of Heroin was expected to stabilize with a concurrent increase in drug purity , which is expected to result in more deaths of drug users .
Costa has issued warnings to health and anti-drug officials in Europe and its neighboring countries , calling on them to pay attention to the latest trends in Afghanistan 's drug cultivation and in international drug-related crimes , and calling on them to take appropriate preventive measures .
According to statistics by the Vienna-based UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention , Heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94 % in 2001 when opium plantation was forbidden in the country . In the following year , Heroin 's degree of purity in Europe 's black market decreased by 50 % .
Between 2000 and 2002 , drug-related deaths in Europe dropped by 20 % .
Costa says that compared with 2003 , the plantation area of opium in Afghanistan has increased by 64 % this year with Heroin 's production reaching up to 500 tons ; higher than the global black market 's one-year trade volume . The trend indicates that the degree of drug purity in the world will rise and drug-related deaths will increase accordingly .
Costa says the drug source in Afghanistan is posing a " clear and real threat " to the world 's anti-drug efforts . The increase of Heroin supply in the black market means the " death verdict " for drug users .
It is estimated that around 100,000 people die in the world each year from drug overuse .
( International ) US Army Confirms Another Guantanamo Detainee Not An Enemy Combatant
Xinhua News Agency report of December 20th from Washington ( by staff reporters Pan Yunzhao and Tan Xinmu ) - The US Defense Department 's Navy Secretary Gordon England said at a Pentagon press conference on the 20th that a military panel had confirmed that a prisoner detained at the US naval base in Guantanamo was not an enemy combatant and would soon be released .

England said the Pentagon confirmed the detainee 's identity one or two days ago and the State Department would inform the detainee 's home country and arrange the release .
However , he did not disclose the detainee 's name and nationality nor under what circumstances the man was captured .
England has refused to admit to mistakes made by the Defense Department in determining Guantanamo detainees ' identities .
He said the military panel responsible for identifying Guantanamo detainees had examined 507 prisoners and confirmed 230 people 's identities , among which 228 identities of enemy combatants have been correct .
So far , the US has released about 200 Guantanamo detainees , some of whom have been released after their return home while a small number have remained in detention following their return . However at least 12 people have taken part in anti-US army activities after being freed .
There are around 550 " Al-Qaeda " and Taliban suspects currently in detention in the US Guantanamo naval base . Most of them were captured during the US war in Afghanistan .
The US government has declared these people as enemy combatants , instead of prisoners of war , who as a result are not protected by the " Geneva Convention " .
Many countries have criticized the US government 's indefinite detention of their citizens while some international organizations have also accused the US government of violating international law .
National Top-Level Node for Domain Names to Settle in Shanghai
Xinhua News Agency report of December 21st from Shanghai ( by staff reporters Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu ) - The China Internet Information Center and Shanghai Information Industry ( Group ) Company Limited signed a deal on the 21st regarding the establishment of a national top-level node for domain names in Shanghai .
Domain names are the basis of communications on which all Internet sites use for E-Business , E-Government , and other applications . At present , they are widely used as Internet addresses .
People wishing to visit websites or send or receive emails must first enter a domain name . The information transfer is then realized through the domain name system 's analysis service which switches the domain name to an IP address to reach the website 's servers .
The domain name system is like a " nerve system " controlling information transfers on the Internet .
According to Mao Wei , Director of the China Internet Information Center which is in charge of China 's national top-level domain name system , the number of China 's Internet users has exceeded 90 million so far , ranking second in the world while the number of websites has surpassed 650,000 .
The analysis volume of domain names goes along with the use of the Internet . The analysis volume of domain names has quickly risen with the speedy development of the Internet .
The number of domain name registrations ending with " dot CN " increases by 10,000 every month , and has reached 430,000 so far .
The national top-level domain name server operated and managed by the China Internet Information Center processes more than 380 million domain name analysis requests each day , with an average of over 4,400 requests per second and more than 8,000 at peak times .
Facing the fast development of the Internet , the China Internet Information Center , the regulatory body in China for registration of domain names , has reevaluated 4 original national top-level nodes for domain names and redeployed its top-level nodes for dot-CN domain names based on such assessment .
In accordance with its Internet development level and the software and hardware conditions of the user units , Shanghai has been selected as the location for installing the national top-level node for domain names .
Sources say there are 45,000 dot-CN domain names in Shanghai so far , with Internet prevalence reaching 26.6 % and both it 's Internet prevalence and application levels leading the country .
There are 130,000 more dot-CN domain names and 230,000 websites in the Eastern China regions neighboring Shanghai , with an advanced development level .
As a result , Shanghai has been chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan .
China Becomes World 's Largest Hard Alloy Producer
Xinhua News Agency report of December 22nd from Nanchang ( by staff reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen ) - China 's hard alloy industry has seen rapid development over the past several years with annual output now exceeding 1 / 3 of the world 's total . In terms of scale and output , China has become the largest hard alloy producer in the world , having a large variety of hard alloy products and the ability to produce most of them .
This was learned on the 22nd by the reporters from the ongoing China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Seminar .
Hard alloy is called " industrial teeth " . Due to its high hardness and durability , it is used for cutting tools , high-tension tools as well as for mining and road-building machinery . The development of the hard alloy industry plays a key role in the development of the whole tungsten industry .
Sources say that China 's hard alloy sector started from scratch in the 1950s and has continued its development , winning outstanding achievements in the process .
In the early 1980s , the world 's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons while China 's annual output was around 5,000 tons . Since the beginning of the 21st century , the world 's annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China 's output has rapidly reached 15,000 tons , accounting for more than 1 / 3 of the world 's total .
Marked progress has also been made in China 's hard alloy exports .
In 1986 , China 's hard alloy exports were only 100 tons but in 2003 , exports reached 2,500 tons . This year exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons , accounting for 1 / 3 of the world 's hard alloy market trade , a share similar to that of its output . The foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports has increased to $ 70 million annually from under $ 4 million in the past .
ADB Offers Loan to Support Shanxi 's Use of Coalbed and Coalmine Methane for Power Generation
Xinhua News Agency report of December 23rd from Beijing ( by staff reporter Jiang Guocheng ) - Sources from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) said on the 23rd that the ADB has recently approved a $ 117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province , which will generate power by utilizing methane produced in coal mining .
The coalbed methane development demonstration project will utilize the latest technologies to boost coalbed and coalmine methane production to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant to be built soon .
According to the project plan , it will offer at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed methane annually to about 90,000 residential , industrial and commercial consumers after its completion in 2008 .
Some 410,000 people in the Jincheng area will benefit .
Shanxi 's coal production accounts for around 1 / 3 of the nation 's total .
The total cost of the project is estimated at $ 237 million , with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation offering a loan of $ 20 million and China Construction Bank offering a loan of $ 37.86 million .
The Jincheng municipal government and two of the local mining / industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling $ 61.24 million .
The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a $ 500,000 grant .
Methane captured from surface well while drilling an underground coal mine is called coalbed methane while methane generated from underground coalmining operations is called coalmine methane .
Methane is highly explosive and needs to be drained before mining operations to ensure safe working conditions .
Removal , capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help ease global warming and climate changes .
Methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas .
Using methane to replace coal can also increase the use of clean fuel , improve coalmine efficiency , and result in cleaner air .
Hassing , an ADB principal project specialist , says the project is expected to result in some 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emission reductions .
( International ) Israel Museum 's Most Precious Possession is Fake
Xinhua News Agency report of December 24th from Jerusalem - Director of the Israel Museum , James Snyder , said on the 24th that an ivory pomegranate , a most precious possession of the museum , had been recently confirmed as a fake .
The ivory pomegranate was once thought to be the only relic discovered so far of King Solomon time 's First Temple .
Snyder said in a statement that the Israeli authority had conducted a careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate .
Experts have found that it is a cultural relic dating to the Bronze Period , much earlier than the First Temple Period of the Jewish people .
The Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate reads : " Belonging to the Temple of Lord Jehovah , holy to the priests . "
However , the inscription has been confirmed to have been carved to it later .
The ivory pomegranate was bought from an anonymous collector by the Israel Museum for $ 550,000 in the 1980s .
Archaeologist and antique experts believe that it was a treasure inlaid on the top of a scepter by a priest of the First Temple .
Snyder says the ivory pomegranate was identified as authentic by Israeli experts including archaeologist Nahman Avigad before its purchase .
Israel 's Haaretz reports that Avigad authenticated the antique carelessly only with a magnifying glass .
The claim has been rejected by Avigad himself .
Over the past several months , Israeli police has uncovered three large-scale cases of antique forgery successively and summoned hundreds of people for interrogation .
Police and the Antiquities Authority unexpectedly found the ivory pomegranate was fake during the investigation .
Police will indict some of the people involved in the case next week .
The Jewish King of Solomon built the First Temple on the Holy Hill in the 10th century BC to enshrine holy items such as the Ark of the Covenant and Noah 's Ark , which were later destroyed .
Shenzhen to Enforce the Use of " Reclaimed Water " in Some Office Buildings and Residential Quarters
Xinhua News Agency report of December 26th from Guangzhou - As a major step in building a " water-saving " city , Shenzhen will enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some large buildings and residential quarters . At present , relevant design specifications and regulations for the " Reclaimed water " are being drafted .
" Reclaimed water " refers to municipal and living wastewater which , after being treated , can reach a certain water standard whereby it can be reused to some extent as undrinkable water .
Its quality is between that of tap water and drainage water .
" Reclaimed water " is generally and extensively used for flushing toilets , gardening and farm irrigation , cleaning roads , car washes , city fountains and supply water for cooling equipment .
An survey by the Shenzhen Water Board shows that more than 70 buildings had " reclaimed water " collection systems in Shenzhen in the mid-1990s . However , due to technology , design and management problems , all the systems were left unused as a result of the excessively high cost of utilizing " reclaimed water " .
Only an additional investment of some 300,000 to 400,000 Yuan is needed to install " reclaimed water " processing systems in order to bring these pipelines back to work .
It is estimated that if all the existing 70 " reclaimed water " systems were put into operation , 35,000 tons of tap water would be saved in Shenzhen each day , based on an average 500 tons of " reclaimed water " to be consumed daily by each residential quarter .
Sources say Shenzhen 's " reclaimed water " collection work will begin with the renovation of the more than 70 buildings with the original " reclaimed water " systems . It will be further popularized based on the experience from the test-run .
Meanwhile , Shenzhen 's water resources authorities will join hands with the urban planning and municipal departments to map out " reclaimed water " design specifications and enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some large buildings .
The treated " reclaimed water " will first be used in city greenbelt irrigation .

Xinhua News Agency report of December 30th from Moscow ( by Staff Reporter Song Shiyi ) - The Director of the Russian Presidential Office and Chairman of the Russian Natural Gas Industrial Corporation ( Gazprom ) , Medvedev , told the press on the 30th that Gazprom would merge the Russian Oil Company ( Rosneft ) as scheduled in January but Yuganskneftegaz , the largest subsidiary company of the Yukos Oil Company purchased by Rosneft , would not be included in Gazprom 's assets .
In another report , when talking about the reason why auctioned assets of Yuganskneftegaz would not be included in the assets of Gazprom , Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share-holder of the Russian Oil and Natural Gas Industrial Corporation and the nation didn 't want to increase its overwhelming share .
He said Yuganskneftegaz 's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company .
On the 19th this month , the Russian Federal Asset Foundation held a public auction to sell 76.79 % of the shares of Yuganskneftegaz , Yukos Oil Company 's largest subsidiary company . The newly formed Baikal Finance Group won the bid with $ 9.35 billion .
On the 22nd , the state-owned Rosneft announced it had purchased Baikal Finance Group , which won the bid for Yuganskneftegaz 's shares , to become the new shareholder of Yuganskneftegaz .
Analysts say one of the important reasons for Russia 's maneuver of the auction of Yuganskneftegaz 's assets is to position itself in a leading position in relevant legal disputes .
In September this year , Russian President Putin approved Gazprom 's merger of Rosneft .
Gazprom was founded in February 1993 and is the world 's largest company in natural gas exploration .
The company holds 65 % of Russia 's natural gas reserves .
Last year , the company 's gas output accounted for 93 % of that in Russia and 20 % in the world .

Officials from the Chennai Fishing Industry Association said on the 31st during interview by Xinhua that even if the fishing boats are repaired , fishermen dare not go out to sea in the next few months as they have seen with their own eyes the sea 's rampage and ferocity .
Some have lost their loved ones and some have suffered economic losses . Their psychological fears will remain for a fairly long time .
It is estimated that the State 's fishery output in 2005 will decline by 30 % as compared with that of 2004 .
During the tsunami on the 26th , most of the coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu State were affected , becoming the most seriously hit area in India .
