Bahraini Princess Married US Soldier , Astonishing 5-Year Marriage Comes to End
The marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and Johnson , a US marine , was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by US television stations . The star-crossed marriage , however , lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas .
Meriam is a member of the Gulf State of Bahrain 's royal family . Johnson risked his military career for this forbidden love . Their marriage , resembling a fairy tale , was once the theme of a TV drama .
However , as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal , five years have scarcely passed when the two confronted each other in court as Meriam filed with the court for divorce in Las Vegas , where quick marriages but even quicker divorces are granted .
The pair met in 1999 when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain .
After he met this little princess who is still in her teens , both fell in love with each other , which changed his life tremendously .
Since their union was forbidden by the royal family , Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , then sneaked her out of her motherland and brought her to the United States .
After a bitter immigration lawsuit with US authorities , the young couple finally got married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip known for its dazzling grandeur when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19 .
However , Johnson said that due to temptations in Las Vegas , otherwise known as a " Sin City , " his constant tensions with Meriam 's rich and powerful family , and rumors of an assassination plot at his life , this star-crossed marriage eventually failed to survive .
Johnson said he made a living by valet parking for guests of hotels and casinos , while Meriam gradually indulged herself to the nightlife in the gambling city , frequenting nightclubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband .
Meriam deserted her husband a year ago .
Johnson said : " She has degraded herself to the bottom . "
Eurozone Economic Indicators This Week Will Show Continued Weakening of Economy in Europe
Economists said that Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output . Meanwhile , British data are expected to show an increase in industrial activities .
They said that economic output data from the largest country in Eurozone will continue to show dramatic monthly fluctuations , but the long-term trend in economic output will show a slow-down of economic growth .
The most important economic indicator this week will be in Germany . The ZEW Institute 's economic expectations index , closely watched by the market and scheduled to be released on the 7th , will provide the first proof of economic confidence in Europe for December .
The ZEW index dropped sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month .
Economists said , as the significant appreciation of the euro will continue to impact the economic confidence in the recent survey , there is no reason to expect any rebound in economic expectations index .
BNP economists said : " Considering that major factors driving down economic confidence , including the appreciation of the euro , the uncertainty of global economy and the deteriorating employment rate in the job market in Germany , are all burdens on the future growth expectations for the December survey period , a strong rebound in expectations index will be unlikely . "
According to the survey of economists conducted by AFX News , AFP 's financial news subsidiary , this index will again slip to 11 in December from 13.9 in the previous month .
But Teather of UBS investment bank said the German ZEW economic expectations index could even drop as low as zero in December .
Teather said : " In our opinion , expectations of future German economic activities will continue to slip as reflected in the ZEW survey of analysts and financial market participants . "
Triggering Tensions between East and West , Crisis in Ukraine Will Become an OSCE Topic
Russia 's repeated allegation about Western interference in Eastern European affairs has drawn increasing attention due to the political crisis in Ukraine and will surely become the major topic at the annual OSCE ministerial meeting to be held tomorrow .
Western power has gradually penetrated into some corners of Europe originally considered by Russia as its backyard , such as the Baltic states , Georgia and Central Asia . This has long displeased Russia . As a result , the recent incident in Ukraine will likely become the major topic at the two-day OSCE meeting to be held in Sofia , capital of Bulgaria .
The Supreme Court in Ukraine has made a dramatic ruling , ordering a re-vote for the recent second round of the presidential run-off , while the European Union earlier called on the OSCE member states to prepare for observers to act " with fastest speed and efficiency . "
Sources in Europe disclosed that in the run-off scheduled to be re-held on December 26 in Ukraine , the number of observers dispatched by the OSCE may increase to 1,000 from the previous 600 .
US Secretary of State Powell will attend this OSCE annual meeting , on perhaps his last tour before leaving his post .
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov , French Foreign Minister Barnier , British Foreign Minister Straw and German Foreign Minister Fischer will also attend the meeting .
The OSCE is made up of 55 countries in North America , Europe , and Asia , and will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year .
This organization was established back then at a meeting held in Helsinki and contributed to the ending of the Cold War .
Bush to Face Big Test as Intelligence Reform Bill Goes for a Vote at Congress This Week
The intelligence reform bill that US Congress will try its best to pass this week marks Republican President Bush 's efforts to press his ambitious second-term agenda and the first big test of his support among Republican congressmen after he was re-elected .
Kean , former Republican governor of New Jersey who led the investigation into the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in the United States , said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the problem with the intelligence reform bill lies in its passage by Congress . This issue alone did not forebode well for the future bipartisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .
Kean said : " If the president and Congress cannot get these big issues taken care of , Congress will become dysfunctional and then we 'll all be in trouble . "
He told New York Daily News : " We 'll have to wait a long time before another bill can get the support of Republican and Democratic leaders in both houses and the support of 80 % of the people in the polls . "
Several congressmen said yesterday that if this history-making reform bill fails , it will delay the overhaul of America 's antiquated spy network operation by months , even years , or even kill it altogether .
Harman , top Democrat on Congress 's House of Representatives ' Intelligence Committee , said yesterday on CNN television : " If this bill cannot be passed this week , it will be dead before being born . "
Congress will make another attempt to pass the " Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 " on the 6th and the 7th before adjourning till early next year .
If it is not passed , the entire act will be scrapped to be re-drafted in the 2005 Congress session .
Ukrainian Opposition Firmly Rejects Constitutional Amendment Bill That Greatly Reduces Presidential Power
Ukrainian pro-Western opposition insisted today that the opposition will not accept the constitutional reform pushed forward by outgoing President Kuchma before re-holding the second round of the presidential run-off .
This constitutional reform will take away the majority of the current presidential power .
After the Supreme Court annulled the November 21 election on the grounds that the second-round of election was riddled with fraud , and the Central Election Commission ordered a repeat run-off on December 26 , the opposition leader Yushchenko again found himself in a stand-off with Kuchman .
Yushchenko 's ally Tymoshenko said : " If the constitutional amendment bill is passed in its current form , all the presidential power will be transferred to the parliament , which is unacceptable . "
She told reporters : " We hope the president can appoint the director of the intelligence bureau and the prosecutor general so that we can fight corruption and eliminate that bloc that controls the political and business communities in Ukraine . "
Kuchma , who has close ties with Russia , pressed for the constitutional amendment ahead of the repeat run-off for fear that the opposition might win the presidential election .
Yesterday opposition parliament members refused to vote on the constitutional amendment bill proposed by the government , which led the parliament to adjourn for ten days .
According to the constitutional amendment bill , except for the prime minister , national defense minister and foreign minister , the power to appoint all other chiefs will be transferred from the president to the parliament where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority .
As set forth in this amendment bill , candidates for the prime minister , national defense minister and foreign minister appointed by the president need to be approved by the parliament , while the parliament can also nominate their candidates .
Political Crisis in Ukraine Enters Third Week as Opposition Calls for Continued Protests
The turmoil in Ukraine triggered by the presidential election entered the third week as the opposition leader Yushchenko called on masses of supporters today to continue their street protests and blockade the presidential office and government buildings till outgoing President Kuchma sacks Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming repeat presidential run-off .
Tens of thousands of Yushchenko supporters have congregated in the capital Kiev for two weeks . They blockaded the government buildings and camped on the main streets specifically designed by Russian experts for military parade . The power of people they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of the presidential election held on November 21 , the Central Election Commission to order a repeat run-off on December 26 , and the parliament to approve firing Yanukovych . However , Kuchma has so far not signed the executive order to remove this successor whom he has nurtured all along .
Yushchenko told the supporting masses that gathered on the capital 's Independence Square tonight that Kuchma should dismiss his government and reorganize the Central Election Commission and that both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the electoral law so as to prevent election fraud .
He said in this speech that kicks off the run-off on December 26 : " There should be no talks on removing the blockade of government buildings or the presidential office before these decisions are made .
For fourteen days , this square has shown a love for Ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of Ukrainian people who can defend their choice . "
He said : " We 're experiencing a struggle between good and evil . The whole world is applauding for our victory , and the whole world is proud of Ukraine . "
While the opposition increased the pressure on the ruling regime backed by Moscow , and Yushchenko and Kuchma faced anew a stand-off on constitutional reforms , Polish President Kwasniewski , Lithuanian President Adamkus , and Russian Special Envoy Gryzlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev for another round of mediation .
Egypt Announces Breakthrough in Middle East Peace Deadlock
Egypt said that the Middle East peace agreement is expected to have a new framework .
It also said that it may soon dispatch its ambassador again to Israel and restore full diplomatic relations that have been discontinued for four years .
Quoting " high-level " Egyptian sources , Egypt 's state-run MENA said that all parties seeking a peace plan have come to a consensus on a comprehensive reconciliation .
MENA said : " Egypt , Israel , Palestine and key international parties such as the United States and the European Union have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . "
Since the Palestinian strongman Arafat passed away last month , the international community has resumed pushing for the policy to restore the Middle East peace in order to bring an early end to years of bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine .
MENA said officials expect " preparations will continue into July and then be followed by political actions . "
MENA said that afterwards , all parties concerned with the Middle East peace process , Israel , Palestine , Egypt , the United States , Russia and several European countries will hold a meeting in Washington .
The meeting is expected to cover " a bilateral ceasefire . " The Palestinian Authority shall " put a stop to anti-Israel attacks and strengthen its control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank . "
Regarding this issue , MENA said , Israeli Prime Minister Sharon promised that " as long as the Palestinian Authority respects the ceasefire agreement and takes good control of its territories , Israel will stop military actions against Palestinians . "
More Than One Billion Children Worldwide Ravaged by War , Poverty and AIDS
The UNICEF annual report released today pointed out that more than one billion children , half of the world 's total , are brutally ravaged by poverty , war and AIDS .
UNICEF said the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing , as clearly laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child , were often imperiled , due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms .
Ms. Bellamy , the UNICEF executive director , pointed out at the annual report launch in London , " When half of the world 's children are growing up in hunger and in unhealthy environment , when schools have become targets of attacks and entire villages are destroyed by AIDS , we have failed to deliver our promise to children . "
Bellamy added : " Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually harm children . "
The statistical data jointly compiled by UNICEF and researchers from Britain 's London School of Economics and Bristol University revealed a horrific picture of children at risk in most part of the world .
Researchers found that some 640 million children worldwide lack adequate shelters , 400 million have no access to safe drinking water , 270 million have no healthcare , 140 million ( mostly girls ) have never attended schools .
More seriously , researchers pointed out , at least 700 million children suffer from all sorts of " severe exploitation , " including no access to information and public sanitation facilities .
The tenth annual report released by UNICEF today pointed out that war and AIDS have destroyed all kinds of networks that normally can protect children and that at times children have become direct victims of war and AIDS .
EU Resists China 's Pressure for Lifting Arms Embargo
The European Union rejected today the pressure from China 's Premier Wen Jiabao to put a quick end to the arms embargo on China yet said it will work hard toward lifting the 15-year-old ban .
The Netherlands , which holds the European Union 's rotating presidency , made the above remark after the EU-China summit .
The Netherlands said there should not be any guesses as to how the European Union is going to put an end to the embargo .
The European Union imposed the arms embargo on Beijing following the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989 .
Although the issue of the arms embargo clouded this China-EU summit , both parties still signed some trade and other agreements at the meeting .
Both China and the European Union claimed that these agreements have strengthened their mutual " strategic partnership . "
The European Union said in a joint statement issued after its summit meeting with China 's Premier Wen Jiabao : " The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo . "
The statement said the Chinese delegation " welcomed this positive signal and believed this signal will benefit the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between China and the European Union . "
Wen Jiabao made no effort to hide his displeasure in a press conference after the summit and said this embargo " does not reflect the partnership between China and the European Union . "
Wen Jiabao said : " This embargo was a result of the Cold War . It cannot reflect the current situation , nor can it reflect the partnership between China and the European Union . "
Led by France , some EU countries are working to have this arms embargo lifted , claiming this embargo is already out of date .
Without adding any amendment to strengthen the related EU laws , some wise EU officials are worried that lifting the embargo may open the floodgates to arms sales and help enhance China 's military capabilities .
Dutch Prime Minister Balkenende said : " I have explained that the European Union has the wish to lift the embargo , but I have also made it clear that lifting the ban is closely connected with making adjustment to the Code of Conduct on arms exports . "
Preliminary Study Yields Inconclusive Finding that Folic Acid May Lead to Breast Cancer
A latest health study pointed out that " folic acid , " a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to prevent birth defects , may increase the risk of getting breast cancer .
However , researchers said the result of their study may be merely the result of chance because other studies show folic acid can actually reduce the risk of breast cancer . Therefore , they urged pregnant women to continue taking this supplement .
Folic acid , found naturally in dark-color leafy vegetables , is known in the medical community to provide a key aid in the growth of a fetus .
Researchers from the two universities of Bristol and Aberdeen in Britain kept track of 3,000 women who , in the 1960s , either took five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo mostly during the second and third trimester of their pregnancy .
The report carried in the British Medical Journal said that by September 2002 breast cancer rates for the women who took five milligrams of folic acid turned out to be twice as high as for those who merely took the placebo .
Ness , one of the researchers , stressed that this result was only " preliminary ... intended to point toward the way toward further research . "
He said : " It is entirely possible that this is a chance result . So further scientific studies are required to examine the association if such an association exists before we reach any conclusion . "
Ness said women who are planning to become pregnant should still take the supplement of folic acid .
He said " there is a considerable difference between the trial dosage " and the current suggested dosage .
According to the British health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a daily dose of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid , more than 10 times smaller than the dose taken by the women in the study .
Two Candidates of Two Entirely Different Moods in Ukraine 's Presidential Re-run
The two opponents confronting each other in Ukraine 's presidential re-run on the 26th of this month have now readied themselves for a decisive battle .
Pro-Western opposition leader Yushchenko is confident of winning the election , while pro-Moscow incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych says he will no longer run on behalf of the " shameful " ruling party .
In the meantime , Russia 's President Putin changed his stance toward Ukraine 's EU accession , saying he would be happy to see Ukraine join the European Union .
Asked what percentage of the vote he is expecting to get in the re-run , Yushchenko said to reporters who packed the conference room : " To be conservative , I should be able to get about 60 % . "
On the other hand , Yanukovych , anxiety written all over his face , evaded directly answering reporters ' questions several times and finally said simply : " By God 's will , we will win . "
Yanukovych , originally trained by current President Kuchma as his successor , has now made a departure , positioning himself as a candidate against both the opposition and ruling parties .
He said , in a manner bordering on name-calling : " I used to trust those cowards and traitors working for the government . Now I feel nothing but great disappointment . This government is indeed a shame . "
In an exchange of conditions with the opposition party , Kuchma tried to amend laws in order to transfer some presidential power to the parliament so as to end massive opposition protests and political turmoil that have gone on for two weeks since the November 21 presidential runoff .
The original winner Yanukovych has also had his election invalidated by the Supreme Court due to the fraud-riddled voting process and must go through a re-election .
Powell Visits Hague to Offer His Final Efforts at US-EU Harmony during His Term
US Secretary of State Powell today held a meeting with top EU officials to offer his final efforts at US-EU solidarity during his term .
The purpose of this European visit by Powell was to repair diplomatic damage on both sides due to the Iraq war . The Hague was his last stop .
The trip may be Powell 's last official visit abroad during his term . The European Union promised him that it will work toward easing tensions between the two sides before US President Bush 's visit to Europe next February .
However , differences between the two sides still linger .
Foreign Minister Bot of the Netherlands , which holds the rotating EU presidency , said : " We must intensify bilateral dialogue during President Bush 's second term and rediscover our common ground . "
Ms. Waldner , EU External Relations commissioner , said she believed Europe and the United States have made some progress in " putting the difficult moments of the Iraq crisis behind , " but she also acknowledged that now is a " key moment in the EU-US relationship . "
Bush will fly to Brussels on February 22 next year to meet with EU and NATO leaders .
Powell said Bush 's visit is meant to mend fissures in the relationship caused by the Iraq issue .
On his visit to Europe , Powell stopped in Sofia and Brussels but made only limited progress toward his goal of improving ties .
This was especially the case in Brussels , where Powell criticized six anti-war NATO countries for hurting the alliance 's " credibility and solidarity " by refusing to participate in training exercises in Iraq .
However , Powell still insisted his meetings have demonstrated US commitment to fully rehabilitating diplomatic relations .
Elected as Romanian President , Basescu Faces Challenges in Organizing Government
Romania 's opposition candidate Basescu today won a closely-fought presidential election , but due to a hung parliament , the center-right mayor of Bucharest may face tremendous challenges in organizing a new government .
According to the final official results released today by Romania 's Central Election Commission , " Justice and Truth Alliance " candidate Basescu won 51.23 % of the vote , while his opponent , Prime Minister Nastase , won 48.77 % .
Nastase conceded defeat and congratulated Basescu .
Outgoing President Iliescu has also congratulated Basescu .
Nastase said his Social Democratic Party will assist Basescu in securing Romania 's smooth accession to the European Union .
The Social Democratic Party won parliamentary elections held on the 28th of last month .
Basescu said at a press conference : " My priority today is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing negotiations for Romania 's entry into the European Union . " Romania must work hard to meet the requirements for EU accession .
He stressed that the Romanian people should understand the price to pay for this integration . The entire country should unite to ensure there are no dissenting voices in Romania against the integration .
Romania has completed its EU membership negotiations and is scheduled to join the union in January 2007 .
Basescu 's agenda also includes combating poverty , tackling corruption , and ensuring judicial independence .
Oliver Stone Wants to Seek Peace with Turkey in Spite of Lingering Dispute over Old Screenplay
Movie director Oliver Stone , while promoting his new movie " Alexander " in Istanbul , tried to take the chance today to make peace with Turkey .
His screenplay for the classic " Midnight Express " was criticized for tarnishing the image of Turkey .
In a special interview here he told AFP : " It has never occurred to me that this screenplay would be against Turkey . This screenplay is meant to be against injustice everywhere . "
Turkey has been denouncing Stone ever since the premier of this award-winning movie in 1978 .
The movie was based on the memoirs of Billy Hayes .
Hayes , a young American , got arrested at Istanbul airport while trying to smuggle hashish from Turkey . After a protracted lawsuit , he was sentenced to 30 years in jail in Turkey .
Turkish critics accused Stone of taking liberties with Hayes 's original work and rewriting it as a racist screenplay in which every Turkish character is , without exception , described as a villain .
The movie is also filled with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture .
Stone admitted : " Perhaps some of the zealousness , some of the anger came from being young at that time and trying to make the point too much , too hard . "
But he added : " It was true that Billy Hayes did get screwed in the Turkish prison . He was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years in jail , and he was treated brutally in prison . So this is all based on facts . "
Stone said : " For a larger picture , Turkey is not the only country that runs an imperfect prison system . America has similar problems . "
Japan 's Economy May Slow down Next Year
Japan 's economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing gap between rich and poor may spoil the harmonious atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of this year .
After a decade of stagnation , high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have brought confidence back to Japan this year , but analysts put their hopes of sustaining economic growth on China despite growing political tensions between Japan and China .
The evidence is growing that Japan 's economy could suffer a brief downturn in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust their inventories to avoid a glut .
According to a new statistic methodology recently adopted , Japan 's economy actually shrank slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1 % in the July-September quarter , narrowly escaping a technical recession .
At present , economists still hold very different opinions on the momentum of economic rebound in Japan .
BNP Paribas researchers estimated that the actual economic growth in Japan can reach 2.3 % for both the current fiscal year ending in March next year and the following fiscal year .
They called 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the US economy is on a steady recovery track and Japan 's consumer spending is making up for slower exports .
In another more pessimistic view , UFJ Institute economists projected only 1.8 % growth in this fiscal year and even a much slower growth of 0.6 % for the following fiscal year .
They cited the " potential risk , " which means corporate profits do not lead to higher personal incomes .
French Foreign Minister : Middle East Peace Process Will Test Ties between France and US
After meeting US Secretary of State Powell today , French Foreign Minister Barnier said the efforts to revive Middle East peace talks will " test " their trans-Atlantic ties .
After the death of the Palestinian leader Arafat , France called for an immediate international conference to push for the peace process between Israel and Palestine . However , there hasn 't been any sign of reaching an agreement after Barnier and Powell finished their meeting .
Barnier flew to Washington from Paris for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his internally designated successor , National Security Adviser Rice , before turning around and heading to Brussels for an EU summit .
Both Paris and Washington agreed to repair bilateral relations strained by the US invasion of Iraq last year , but the two countries still remain very much divided on the resolution to the Middle East deadlock .
After a brief talk with Powell at the US State Department , Barnier said : " We hope to improve future relations between France and the United States , and between Europe and America . "
He said : " I think the test at the heart of this relationship ... is our ability to launch the peace process between Palestine and Israel . "
Earlier this week Barnier called for an immediate international conference on the Middle East to take advantage of what he termed a " window of opportunity " created after Arafat 's death last month .
But Powell still did not want to make any commitment .
He said the two had spoken of British plans to hold a meeting participated by Palestinians but did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held .
US officials have made it clear that their priority is to promote peace in Israel and Palestine and to ensure smooth Palestinian elections next month .
The elections will produce a leader who could rein in Islamic militants and revive talks between Israel and Palestine .
Foreign Minister Machimura Proposes Japan and South Korea Hold FTA Negotiations Next January
Japan 's Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold negotiations on a free trade agreement ( FTA ) as early as January next year .
According to the report by Jiji Press , during a meeting with Ban Ki-Moon , South Korea 's minister of foreign affairs and trade , in Ibusuki City of the southern Kagoshima County , Machimura said the two sides should resume the negotiations as early as possible since both Tokyo and Seoul authorities hope to sign an FTA by the end of 2005 .
Before Machimura 's talks with Ban Ki-Moon , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun held a summit on the 17th . During the talks , Roh Moo-Hyun urged Tokyo authorities to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against North Korea .
As North Korea abducted several Japanese nationals during the Cold War , Prime Minister Koizumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish North Korea .
After Japanese researchers confirmed last week that the remains provided by Pyongyang authorities to prove the death of the two hostages were not the remains of the parties involved , the families of kidnapping victims were outraged .
Apart from the abduction issue , Koizumi and Roh Moo-Hyun agreed that six-party talks aimed at halting North Korea 's development of nuclear weapons should resume as early as possible .
Since North Korea 's secret development of nuclear weapons triggered a stand-off in October 2002 , three rounds of six-party talks have taken place but all failed to achieve concrete results .
North Korea later boycotted a fourth round of six-party talks originally scheduled for September this year .
The six parties for the talks are respectively South Korea , North Korea , the United States , China , Japan , and Russia .
Thai Premier Thaksin Still Expected to Win Elections in February Next Year
When Thai Premier Thaksin heads into 2005 , he is confident of winning a second four-year term . However , his reputation has already been tarnished because he has failed to quell a bloody separatist insurgency .
As Thailand 's national elections have been scheduled for February 6 next year , Thaksin and his political opponents are actively preparing for the elections . In the opinion of most analysts , he is expected to win despite this year 's serious southern violence and epidemic of bird flu .
This year a total of twelve people in Thailand died from bird flu , which swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand . The Thai government frankly admitted it " made a mistake " in its handling of the epidemic .
However , this health concern is unlikely to ruin Thaksin 's chance of a second term . On the contrary , many people are asking only how extensive his victory will be , and what will his election victory mean to the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .
Kraisak , chairman of the parliamentary Senate 's Committee on Foreign Affairs , told AFP : " The phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at Thaksin , he has won broad popular support at this moment . "
He said : " But things will start to disintegrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and those close to him ) , the social injustices and the violence . "
It is exactly because of social injustice and violence , insurgency broke out in the Muslim-dominant deep south of Thailand , where sporadic separatist incidents have occurred continuously since January .
Since January this year , Islamic radicals have targeted Buddhists , government officials and security forces in gun battles and they have also carried out bombings and beheadings . As of now more than 560 people have died , and another 100 are missing .
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Claims Arafat Was Poisoned about a Year Ago
Abdelrahman , Cabinet secretary for late Palestinian leader Arafat , disclosed that Arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his Ramallah headquarters .
Abdelrahman told the Al-Hayat newspaper : " About a year ago , something strange happened to Arafat . It was on September 25 , 2003 .
At that time the chairman was shaking hands one by one with some 30 representatives of supporters . Shortly afterwards , the chairman started to vomit .
Since then the chairman 's health started to deteriorate gradually . "
Arafat died of a mysterious illness in a French hospital on November 11 .
Some of Palestinian top officials thought Arafat had been poisoned .
However , French doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations .
Two weeks before the delegation visit to Arafat mentioned by Abdelrahman , the Israeli Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Sharon had just made the decision to depose Arafat , only without specifying by what means .
This threat from Israel prompted a wave of people 's support for Arafat , who subsequently received several delegations of supporters .
Abdelrahman recalled , " Arafat shook hands with these people who came to express their support for Arafat besieged by Israel . "
On September 25 last year , Arafat received two groups successively . One was a group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission . The other was a group of political activists .
Abdelrahman pointed out , " October 12 this year was the last time when Arafat got ill . The symptoms were the same , vomiting , lack of appetite and all the similar symptoms of having the flu . "
Bush Admits Need to Step up Training for Iraqi Troops and Vigorously Defends Rumsfeld
US President Bush admitted today that Iraqi troops are not yet ready to replace US troops and warned that the elections scheduled for January 30 next year would not spell the end of serious violence in Iraq .
In an-hour-long press conference , Bush also expressed his support for Defense Minister Rumsfeld , insisting the Pentagon chief was " doing a really fine job . "
Bush said , despite some sharp disagreements sometimes , he vowed to continue working with Russian President Putin . He also said that now is the time to make progress toward ending the Middle East conflict .
He also believed that the best way to deal with surviving " axis of evil " members Iran and North Korea is to go through multilateral diplomacy .
After yesterday 's successive car bombings killed 66 people and injured more than 200 in the two Iraqi Islamic Shiite pilgrimage cities of Najaf and Karbala , Bush admitted frankly that violence was taking its toll on Iraqi people but insisted the elections in January must take place as scheduled .
Bush warned Americans that Iraq 's elections " are just the beginning of a political process " and cautioned that " I certainly don 't think the process will be trouble-free . "
Bush also acknowledged that training Iraqi security forces had mixed results .
He said : " Sometimes when fighting intensified , they ( Iraqi troops ) would desert the battlefield . "
He said this kind of Iraqi troops will never be able to protect the national security , which is unacceptable .
However , he believed that after a long period of training by US troops , the training of Iraqi troops will achieve results .
White House : Iraqi Insurgents ' Attempt to Sabotage Elections Is Doomed to Fail
In response to insurgents ' attack on a dining hall in a US military base in the major city of Mosul in northern Iraq at noon today that killed 22 US and Iraqi soldiers and injured more than 60 , the White House Spokesman McClellan said there will be more rampant terrorist activities by Iraqi insurgents as Iraqi elections approach , but these " enemies of freedom " will be surely wiped out .
Reports from Iraq said that a single massive explosion occurred at noontime in a US military base dining hall when officers and soldiers were eating , resulting in heavy casualties .
The Iraqi Provisional Government set January 30 for the first elections since the downfall of the Hussein regime .
The United States has sent nearly 20,000 additional troops to ensure security in Iraq during the elections .
The total number of US troops in Iraq during the elections will reach 150,000 .
Mclellan said as the elections approach , Hussein loyalists and insurgents will create more terrorist attacks in an attempt to sabotage the interim government . They want to go back to the past but " they will be wiped out , and they are being wiped out . "
Reacting to a latest poll which shows 56 % of Americans think the Iraq war " is not worth fighting , " 57 % disapprove the way President Bush is handling the situation in Iraq , and 52 % think Defense Minister Rumsfeld should step down , Mclellan said President Bush will not dance attendance on polls .
" Polls are momentary numbers , while we continue to do our job based on the progress we made in Iraq . "
Crowds of Mourners Attend Funeral for Philippine Politician Poe
A large crowd of Filipino movie fans attended today 's funeral for Poe , the country 's most famous movie star . The ceremony was conducted under tight security for fear of unrest .
Poe , 65 , had unsuccessfully run for president .
A crowd of mourners escorted the coffin carrying Poe 's body as it was pulled through the streets of the capital of Manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .
An army of riot police was deployed around Malacanang Palace to prevent violence from Poe supporters .
These supporters had accused President Arroyo of cheating in the May 10 presidential election .
The military also raised its alert level due to intelligence reports about an imminent coup to overthrow Arroyo and replace her with Rocess , Poe 's surviving widow .
However , the funeral procession ended peacefully . Movie fans shouted out the letters FPJ , the initials of Poe 's name , and waved his campaign posters .
Poe died of a stroke on December 14 .
As the hearse wound its way toward the cemetery , weeping women and children tossed flowers at the coffin .
Following Justice Secretary Gonzales 's warning that some people might take advantage of the funeral to make trouble , large freight containers were placed as road blocks around Malacanang Palace close to the funeral procession route .
Gonzales said that " reliable intelligence reports " indicated a plot to use the occasion of the funeral procession and interment to incite people against the government .
However , Lt. Col. Pascual , a military spokesman , said that the political coup had apparently dissipated after the military deployed troops to guard key areas .
Arroyo later walked out of Malacanang Palace to greet the military police who were guarding the area .
Syria Must Cooperate with US on Issue of Israel and Lebanon , Armitage Warns
US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage issued warnings to Syria today , saying the development of future relations between Damascus and Washington depends on whether Syria wants to cooperate with the United States on the issues of Iraq and Lebanon .
Armitage renewed greater pressures on Syria when he was interviewed by reporters from Arab countries .
The interview was released earlier by the State Department .
Asked whether he expected continued tensions between the United States and Syria , Armitage replied : " I certainly hope the relations will be improved , but this depends on how ( Syrian President ) Al-Assad and his men behave . "
The US State Department Number Two pointed out that Damascus should implement the UN Security Council Resolution 1559 passed in September this year and end as soon as possible all interferences in its neighboring country Lebanon .
Armitage said Syria 's behavior was " not a defiance of the United States but a defiance of the entire international community . "
Reporters asked again whether the United States will raise the issue of Syria 's refusal to cooperate when the UN Security Council discusses whether UN peacekeeping troops should remain in Lebanon in January next year . To this , Armitage replied : " We 'll very likely do that . "
Speaking of the Iraq issue , Armitage acknowledged that Damascus had indeed taken some steps that met US expectations by reinforcing joint border patrols with Iraq and halting insurgent funding .
However , he also said that Syria " still needs to make greater efforts . "
AIT and TECRO Sign Lease Today for New Building Site in Neihu
The American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office ( TECRO ) signed a lease today for a new building site in Neihu . Douglas Paal , director of the AIT Taipei Office , said the new building is now being designed , and that he hopes it will be completed soon so the institute 's work can be done in a safe and modern facility .
Douglas Paal and TECRO Secretary General John Chen signed a 99-year lease for the new AIT office building site at noon in Taipei 's Chun Yue Hotel .
Witnesses were David Keegan , deputy director of the AIT Taipei Office , and Jacqueline Liu , deputy secretary general of TECRO . Minister of Foreign Affairs Mark Chen was also present for the ceremony .
AIT , established under the Taiwan Relations Act to handle unofficial civil exchanges between the United States and Taiwan , has offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung .
Douglas Paal said in his speech that AIT has been working with TECRO and the Taipei city government for over a decade to find a new AIT office building site .
He said the current office at Hsing Yi Road looks shabby and lacks enough space .
For AIT , relocating to the new office building will be a challenge , as it will be able to consolidate offices currently scattered throughout Taipei to operate in a safe and modern facility .
He said the new building is currently being planned and designed in a way that he hopes will add features to Taiwan 's architecture and become a point of pride for Taipei residents .
Upon completion of the planning and design , contract bidding will be set for construction , which will begin right after the contractor has made its decision . It is hoped that groundbreaking will take place within the next few years .
AIT spokeswoman Dana Shell-Smith said the building 's cost , including the site lease and architectural design , is estimated at about US $ 160 million . Its completion in 2008 depends on many factors , though it is hoped to be done as quickly as possible .
Thousands of Pilgrims Rush to Attend Christmas Eve Mass in Bethlehem
Thousands of pilgrims are gathering in the West Bank town of Bethlehem for Christmas Eve mass .
In the meantime , PLO mainstream group Al Fatah is expected to have defeated Hamas in yesterday 's local Palestinian elections .
Regarding violence and conflict , a gun battle broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in Gaza , resulting in the deaths of three young Palestinians .
Israeli settlers , on the other hand , blockaded a main road in protest against mortar attacks on their settlement .
Also , PLO leader Abbas was allowed to travel to the West Bank town of Bethlehem . It was the first time in the past four years that Israeli authorities allowed a key Palestinian leader to attend Christmas celebrations there .
Late Palestinian leader Arafat was a regular guest at the midnight mass in Bethlehem following his return to the Palestinian area in 1994 . But since early December 2001 , Arafat had been confined to his Ramallah headquarters by Israeli troops .
The Latin Patriarch Sabbah of Jerusalem left that city in early afternoon for his traditional trip to Bethlehem 's Manger Square , where thousands of Christian pilgrims and Muslim spectators had long been congregating .
Sabbah was scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at Church of the Nativity midnight mass .
By noon , Manger Square was packed with a continuous stream of pilgrims toting Santa Claus balloons entering and leaving the Church of the Nativity . Outside the church , a Christmas tree was festooned with various lights and decorations .
Israeli authorities eased travel restrictions in a special effort to make it convenient for Christians from the Gaza Strip , the West Bank , and Israel to attend Christmas Eve mass in Bethlehem .
Putin Claims Taking over Main Asset of Yukos Was for Protecting National Interest
Russian President Putin said today that Russia was protecting its national interest by its acquisition of the main asset of Russia 's oil giant Yukos , a first move of re-nationalization in the post-Soviet era .
Referring to Rosneft 's acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz , a Yukos subsidiary , Putin said at the end-of-year press conference held in the Kremlin : " Russia is now protecting the national interest by using absolute legal market mechanism .
And I consider this perfectly normal . "
Rosneft today has become the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after acquiring Baikalfinansgroup which won Yuganskneftegaz earlier at a secretive auction .
Earlier last midnight Rosneft announced unexpectedly that it had acquired 100 % of shares of the previously unknown Baikalfinansgroup .
The acquisition allows Kremlin to have a tight control of Russia 's critical energy sector .
For nearly 18 months in the past , Russian authorities had been attacking Yukos and its imprisoned billionaire founder Khodorkovsky .
Since Rosneft is merging with Gazprom , combined with Yuganskneftegaz , the consolidated trio will control one fifth of Russia 's total oil output and all its natural gas production to become the world 's largest energy group .
Putin justified the state 's current acquisition by criticizing the under-the-table privatization in the 1990s .
The privatization measures at that time caused the crown jewels of the Russian economy to fall into the hands of a few slick businessmen such as Khodorkovsky .
Baikalfinansgroup earlier won the controlling rights to Yuganskneftegaz by offering US $ 9.35 billion for the bid .
Yushchenko Claims Victory in Ukraine 's Presidential Election
As the preliminary election results showed opposition leader Yushchenko took the lead in the presidential re-run over his opponent , incumbent Prime Minister Yanunovych , and Yushchenko himself also declared victory , his supporters today gathered again in Kiev 's central Independence Square to celebrate the victory .
The 50-year-old Yushchenko said to people gathering in the square : " This is a unique and clean political victory . "
He said : " This is a noble victory . People have demonstrated their power . The Ukrainian people have stood up bravely to fight against what may be the most perverted regime among eastern European countries . And today the Ukrainian nation and its people have won the victory . "
He said : " For 14 years , we have been independent but not free . "
Yushchenko added : " Today Ukraine has unfolded a new political era .
The era of ( outgoing President ) Kuchma , ( Kuchma 's predecessor ) Kravtchouk and ( current Prime Minister ) Yanukovych has gone down in history . "
Citing the statistical results of the vote count in more than half of the precincts , Ukraine 's Central Election Commission said today that opposition leader Yushchenko , in this historic presidential re-vote , has taken a temporary 16-point lead over his opponent , current Prime Minister Yanukovych .
Ukraine 's Central Commission said pro-Western Yushchenko won 56.33 % of the vote , while pro-Russia Yanukovych got 39.86 % .
This statistical result was based on the vote count by 50.96 % of Ukraine 's polls .
There are more than 33,000 polls throughout Ukraine .
In addition , the exit polls released earlier also showed that Yushchenko led Yanukovych by 15 to 20 percentage points .
Japan 's MIC Pilots telecommuting to Reduce Office Stress on Families
Japan 's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ( MIC ) today kicked off the promotion of an advanced Internet program , through which , it hopes , 20 % of Japan 's workforce can " telecommute " to work from home by 2010 so as to reduce the stress of office work and its consequent toll on families .
An MIC official said that currently some 4 million Japanese , or 6 % of Japan 's workforce of 63.2 million , take advantage of science and technology to work from outside office .
Beginning January , six MIC staffers can stay away from office at least one day in a week and work instead from their homes , universities , or libraries through the high speed Internet services .
Based on feedbacks , the MIC will expand the scope of this advanced program until 20 % of its 2,500 employees can work from home by 2006 .
The MIC official said that this program allowing employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing is expected to " improve workplace efficiency . "
He said telecommuting allows employees more time to be with their families and enables breadwinners to assist more in household chores .
He said the program can also reduce traffic jam , including vehicle emissions and overcrowding on trolleybuses during peak hours .
He said the goal of the program is to raise the percentage of Japanese telecommuters to 10 % by 2005 and further to 20 % by 2010 " by encouraging the sharing of the telecommuting technology with private sector . "
Pentagon Launches Unprecedented Relief Operations for Asian Tsunami Victims
The Pentagon said today that it has launched one of the biggest relief operations in its history to assist victims of Asian tsunamis , mobilizing two aircraft carrier strike groups , 20 airplanes including reconnaissance and supply planes , and tens of thousands of personnel .
Lieutenant Commander Hicks , a Pentagon spokesman , said that the US military faced the challenge of operating in several areas simultaneously after the tsunami catastrophe on the 26th that left over 80,000 people dead .
He told AFP : " This is one of the biggest humanitarian relief operations by the Pentagon . "
Lieutenant General Conway , an official in charge of military operations for the Joint Chief of Staff , said that they are seeking to assess the extent of this catastrophe and have already dispatched disaster relief assessment teams to Thailand , Sri Lanka and Indonesia .
The Pentagon said that it has dispatched 20 airplanes to South Asia , including six C-130 transport planes carrying drinking water and food , five KC-135 air refueling tanker planes , and nine P3 reconnaissance planes .
The Pentagon has also mobilized aircraft carriers " the Lincoln " and " the Richard " with their groups of ships .
Conway said that " the Lincoln " strike group with its accompanying 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel has left Hong Kong for the Gulf of Siam and will eventually deploy off the coast of Sumatra .
" The Richard " carrying 25 helicopters , 2,100 Marines , and 1,400 sailors has left the Island of Guam and is expected to reach the Bay of Bengal by January 7 next year .
The Pentagon has decided to mobilize additional five ships from Guam and two ships from its base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia that can produce fresh water .
Conway said that the US military relief operations will be headquartered in its Thai base of Utapao on the Gulf of Siam .
At Least 169 Dead and 375 Injured in Nightclub Blaze in Capital of Argentina
City officials in Buenos Aires , capital of Argentina , said today that a blaze in a nightclub in downtown Buenos Aires on the evening of the 30th killed at least 169 people and injured 375 .
The fire broke out when the nightclub was packed with some 2,000 young people celebrating the end of the school year .
The City Health Secretary Stein said the above casualties are not the final figures yet .
Fernandez , Argentina 's interior minister , told reporters outside the smoldering nightclub , " This is a disaster ! This is a disaster ! " and warned the death toll was only provisional .
Stein said at least 375 people were injured in the blaze , including 19 police officers .
Stein said that a fire broke out in this downtown discotheque before midnight on the 30th when some 2,000 young people were attending a rock concert there .
Mayor Ibarra of Buenos Aires said that unconfirmed reports claim the fire was caused when flares were tossed during the concert .
Ibarra told Today 's News television station : " This is a horrible night . "
While firefighters were trying their best to put out the blaze , bodies of victims were lined up on the street .
Chaos reigned early this morning outside the blazing discotheque when hundreds of police officers and firefighters got mixed up with frightened young people and anxious parents searching frantically for their children .
UN : Relief Supplies Weeks Away for Aceh Survivors
The United Nations said today that it will take " weeks " for urgently-needed relief supplies to reach tsunami survivors in the isolated areas of Indonesia 's Aceh Province .
US navy helicopters have arrived today in Banda Aceh , capital of Aceh Province . Meanwhile , more and more field hospitals have started operating in the city and large shipments of relief supplies are arriving at the airport .
However , Elmquist , the chief of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia , told reporters that a host of coordination and infrastructure problems made it impossible for a prompt delivery of relief supplies .
After returning to the capital Jakarta from Banda Aceh , Elmquist told reporters over the phone : " It will take us weeks before we can deliver relief supplies to all the isolated areas . "
He said : " This is a serious concern . We are trying all we can to find ways to establish an aid distribution system in Banda Aceh . "
The United Nations and other relief organizations have warned that people in the affected Sumatra area in Indonesia may die within a few days if they cannot immediately get clean drinking water , food , and medical treatment .
Asked whether delays in delivery mean death sentences for some tsunami survivors , Elmquist replied : " I hope not . I hope survivors can manage to find food and drinking water , but this is certainly not the situation we would be happy to see . "
He said : " This is a very serious situation . We can only hope that it is possible to speed up the operation . "
Japan Tops World Donors with Pledge of US $ 500 Million in Relief Aid
Japan pledged US $ 500 million in relief aid today to countries devastated by the massive tsunami in the Indian Ocean . While all nations compete with one another in offering aid to survivors of the most lethal catastrophe in the world , this contribution not only made Japan the top donor of all nations but also raised the money hitherto pledged by the international community for relief and reconstruction to a total of US $ 1.6 billion .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said in a statement that Japan , as the largest economy in Asia , will consider providing more assistance including money and technology .
He said : " Japan will try to its maximum capacity to provide assistance in three ways : financial resources , knowledge and technology , and human resources . "
He said : " Japan will , for the time being , first provide a grant of US $ 500 million to affected countries and relevant international organizations as emergency aid to cope with the disaster . "
Koizumi also said that he will attend the meeting of world leaders to be held on the 6th in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta to discuss assistance to tsunami-stricken countries .
After US President Bush was accused of being slow to respond to this human catastrophe , the US government increased its pledge of aid tenfold to US $ 350 million yesterday .
China , which is seen as increasingly challenging Japan 's influence in Asia , has also promised US $ 60.5 million in aid , a huge sum for a developing nation .
Koizumi said : " Japan will mobilize fire department helicopters and personnel to make further contribution .
Japan will also consider providing more assistance , as soon as possible , including mobilizing Japan 's Self-Defense Forces aircraft , ships and personnel . "
Japan previously pledged US $ 30 million in aid to tsunami-stricken countries .
A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Koizumi 's pledge of US $ 500 million also includes that amount of US $ 30 million .
WHO : 50 Organizations to Provide Medical Aid to Aceh in Indonesia
The WHO said today that 50 aid groups have arrived in the Indonesian province of Aceh ready to provide medical assistance to tsunami survivors .
WHO representative in Indonesia Peterson said that the WHO is trying to coordinate all groups and has held a meeting with them this afternoon .
Peterson said the coordination is challenging as many groups have gone directly to Aceh to administer relief .
In a telephone interview in Jarkata , Peterson said : " We are trying to sort things out . Every group has just arrived , yet each has also expressed their willingness to work together . "
Peterson reiterated that the WHO is mainly concerned with preventing outbreaks of such diseases as cholera and dysentery , which can cause deaths by tens of thousands .
Peterson said : " We are very worried because we have many displaced people , who don 't have adequate clean water or appropriate food .
So we have all the conditions necessary for an outbreak of epidemic . "
However , Peterson stressed there hasn 't been any sign yet of these diseases .
Indonesian Health Ministry said the death toll in Sumatra during the tsunami may be as high as 100,000 with most of the victims in the province of Aceh .
Since most of the medical facilities have been destroyed in the province of Aceh , Indonesian military , Singapore , and Australian government have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week . The UNICEF has also started to distribute basic medical kits to assist 200,000 children .
Powell Predicts Shiite Victory in Iraqi Elections
US Secretary of State Powell today predicted a Shiite victory in the upcoming Iraqi elections , but he also believed there should not be too much concern that the Shiite victory may increase Iranian influence because there are past disagreements between Iraqi and Iranian Shias .
There has been growing evidence that Sunni Muslims may boycott the elections on January 30 or may be prohibited from participating in the elections by the relevant Iraqi authorities due to their spreading of insurgency .
Powell said on NBC 's Meet the Press program : " The new government going into power and the transitional national assembly will be majority Shiite .
The majority of Iraqi population is also Shiite . "
Shiite Muslims make up more than 60 % of Iraq 's population , living mostly in southern and central areas .
On the other hand , Sunnis live in central and western provinces and comprise 20 % of the population .
Former Foreign Minister Pachachi , who now heads the Sunni-dominated " Iraqi Independent Democrats Party , " called today for postponing the elections , but Powell said the Iraqi elections will go ahead as scheduled .
Powell also said he did not think Shiites ' control of the future Iraqi government could mean Iran would manipulate the political situation in Iraq .
He said : " My feeling now is that even if there might be Iranian influence--Iran will , of course , try to influence the political situation in Iraq , but there are quite significant differences and past serious disagreements and conflicts between Iranian and Iraqi Shias . "
Time Is Running against Tsunami Victims as International Relief Aid Pours In
Foreign troops on relief mission are dropping food from helicopters in areas hit by the Asian tsunamis and setting up drinking water distribution systems to assist millions of displaced and famished tsunami survivors .
According to statistics , the death toll has climbed to nearly 150,000 .
Relief supplies from governments keep coming in while US President Bush put his father , Bush senior , and former President Clinton in charge of efforts to raise private donations .
In the meantime , the delegation led by US Secretary of State Powell arrived in Thailand last night to show US concern and assess the progress of relief efforts before they head off to a crisis summit to be held in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on the 6th .
Powell 's delegation includes President Bush 's brother Jeb Bush , governor of Florida , and Natsios , administrator of US Agency for International Development .
Powell , heading the delegation , will tour Thailand , Indonesia , and Sri Lanka to inspect the disaster devastation before attending the summit on the 6th .
Powell said the mission of his delegation is to assess the disaster situation and " see what else the United States needs to do , " but there will be no immediate promise of additional aid beyond the US $ 350 million already committed .
As days went by after the disaster , there are talks now of giving up the search for thousands of tourists not yet accounted for . Many of them were foreign tourists .
But Thai Premier Thaksin vowed to continue the search in his country .
Thaksin told reporters on Phuket Island : " Foreign experts told me they ( the missing ) might have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . We will continue the search by all means and will not stop . "
The international relief effort of the largest scale in history is still underway .
Navy helicopters dispatched from the US aircraft carrier " the Lincoln " have been on their mission to drop relief supplies and pick up survivors in the Indonesian province of Aceh for a second day .
Rear Admiral Crowder , commander of the Lincoln , said 50,000 pounds of food and water had so far been delivered to affected areas and the operation was " going smoothly . "
Behind Tsunami Catastrophe Relief Efforts Lies Political Jostle
As Asian tsunami disaster relief supplies continuously poured into affected areas , a less praiseworthy operation is also secretly underway : Governments are jostling over who should be giving money , who should be receiving aid and who should be leading this relief operation of the largest scale in modern times .
The catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled the old fire of war , including the discord among the United States , the United Nations and Europe , and the struggle for leadership in Asia .
Relief experts , however , are still hoping with caution that the global nature of this tsunami catastrophe that devastated so many countries might lead to another precedent : Governments that promised to provide aid will actually honor their words .
Juma , professor of international development of Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , said : " Promises of aid made by governments have never been carried out 100 % and on time . "
With pledged donations from governments hitting US $ 2 billion , major players in the international political arena including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell , and leaders from Australia , China and Japan will hold a crisis summit with strong political overtones in Jarkata on the 6th .
After accusations of a slow response and top UN relief official Egeland 's public criticism of rich countries for " being stingy , " US President Bush raised US aid nearly tenfold to US $ 350 million .
In Asia , the tsunami catastrophe triggered a secretive jostle for regional influence as an increasingly confident China pledged US $ 60.5 million in aid , an impressive big sum for a developing country .
Japan , which has cut down foreign aid budget for six straight years , also quickly debunked the notion that its national power is declining by vowing to provide at least US $ 500 million in aid , a sum putting all other nations to shame .
World Leaders Arriving to Tour Disaster-hit Sri Lanka
Sri Lankan officials said world government leaders including UN Secretary General Annan , US Secretary of State Powell have arrived in succession in Sri Lanka to inspect firsthand the devastation of the massive tsunami that claimed 30,600 lives in Sri Lanka at the end of last month .
They said Powell has arrived here and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan will be coming in early afternoon .
In a press release by the US embassy , it is said that Powell will tour some areas hit hardest by the tsunami on December 26 last year , including the southern region of Galle where US Marines are stationed for relief operations .
South Korean embassy , on the other hand , said Lee Hae-chan will tour the western coastline accompanied by Sri Lanka 's prime minister .
The statement said : " Accompanied by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Rajapakse , South Korea 's prime minister will tour the western coast to view firsthand the destruction of lives , livelihood and property . "
Lee Hae-chan will stop over in Hambantota , the worst affected area , to oversee relief operations being carried out by private and non-governmental organizations from South Korea .
Meanwhile , UN Secretary General Annan is scheduled to arrive in the evening for a two-day visit .
The UN Spokesman Samarsinghe said : " He will be touring along with World Bank President Wolfhensohn the affected regions in the south and the east . "
WHO Secretary General Lee Joog-Wook will also arrive in Colombo today .
German Foreign Minister Fischer is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka by the weekend .
Sri Lankan officials said more world leaders will be arriving in the next few weeks .
These leaders include Canadian Prime Minister Martin . Canada announced yesterday that Martin will visit Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month .
Bush : US to Step up Peace Efforts after Palestinian Elections
US President Bush said today that he was " deeply heartened " by the high turnout for today 's Palestinian elections and pledged to step up US peace efforts .
Bush said in a statement : " Palestinians throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip took a key step toward building a future democracy by choosing a president of the new self-rule government through elections .
The election observers described the elections as free and fair . "
He said : " This is a historic day for the Palestinian people and the people in the Middle East . "
Exit polls showed that former Prime Minister Abbas won the elections by a wide margin with two thirds of the vote .
He will succeed Arafat to become the president of the Palestinian self-rule government .
Bush said : " These efforts , including today 's presidential elections and the elections for the national assembly in a few months , are essential for the establishment of a sovereign , independent , democratic and peaceful Palestinian state . The new state will ensure the security of Israel . "
He said the US government expects to work with the newly-elected president of the Palestinian self-rule government and the Palestinian people so as to press forward the great cause of the Middle East peace .
The Middle East peace conforms to the common wish of Israeli and Palestinian peoples for living side by side in peace and security .
Bush also urged Israel to help improve human rights and economic conditions on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
He added that Arab countries must " take joint concrete steps with all relevant parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , offer financial support to the Palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists . "
Annan 's Plan to Visit Rebel-Controlled Areas in Sri Lanka Blocked
UN Secretary General Annan said today that he hopes to be able to return to Sri Lanka some day to " visit every part of the country . "
Annan recently ended his two-day visit to tsunami-hit areas in Sri Lanka . However , reports said that the Sri Lankan government had tried to block him from visiting rebel-controlled northern areas .
Asked at a press conference whether the Sri Lankan government had blocked him from visiting rebel LTTE ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ) controlled areas , as reported by many national newspapers , Annan said : " I hope I can return to visit every part of the country and assist in accelerating the peace process . "
Annan said President Kumaratunga had personally objected to his on-site visit to guerrilla-held areas because she feared the rebels might use his visit as a political bargaining chip .
He said : " I brought up the issue of the peace process and the need to intensify peacemaking efforts .
I also discussed the issue with President Kumaratunga . "
Annan 's inability to visit rebel-controlled areas triggered great anger among residents of the rebel-controlled northern city of Jaffna . Hundreds of people staged a protest in front of the UN office in Jaffna .
The Sri Lankan government , however , resolutely denied media reports , saying the media " had misled " on the issue .
In the meantime , as relief efforts from all sides moved forward at full steam , Sri Lanka 's meteorology department issued warnings of a typhoon strike along the country 's coastline . The typhoon is currently forming at sea .
Russian Space Agency Denies Rocket Fuel Causes Sickness among Children
Britain 's weekly science journal Nature reported that the highly toxic rocket fuel spewed out as spaceships were launched at the Baikonur space base in Kazakhstan of Russia has caused serious sicknesses in children in the surrounding neighborhood , but Russian Space Agency denied this claim today .
Citing a research study , the science journal Nature published today said the levels of endocrine and blood diseases among residents in the polluted area are twice as high as that in normal areas .
The study was conducted by a group of Russian scientists led by Epidemiologist Zykov .
Russian Space Agency said in response : " No direct influence of space-related activities on the health of residents has been established . "
The study cited by the science journal Nature mainly studies the children in Altai Republic .
Altai Republic is located in the mountainous region on the fringes of Siberia .
Altai Republic was chosen for the subject of the study because it was polluted by un-burnt fuel , hydrazine in particular .
Some of Russian Space Agency 's launching missions used hydrazine as fuel for the initial few stages .
Zykov compared the health records of some 1,000 children in two polluted areas during 1998 to 2000 with the health records of a control group 's 3,300 children in nearby unpolluted areas .
The science journal Nature reported that Zykov concluded the ratio of medical care needed for children in the current most polluted area is nearly twice as much as that for the unpolluted control group . The time needed for treatment is also twice as long .
Iraqi Election Will Be Flawed , White House Says
White House acknowledged today that the Iraqi election slated for January 30 " is not going to be perfect . " Meanwhile , two car bombing attacks took place again in Mosul in Iraq , killing at least two Iraqi soldiers .
Asked whether he agreed with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi 's remark that violence will make voting impossible in some areas in Iraq , White House Spokesman McClellan said : " We all admit that this election is not going to be perfect . "
He said : " This is the first time that Iraqi people can freely choose their leaders . This is an election for a transitional government , and also one of the three elections that are to take place this year . "
McClellan said : " So we will try our best to assist the Iraqi people and the transitional government to ensure as many people as possible take part in this upcoming election . "
Bloody violence broke out in Iraq on the 11th , killing at least 25 people , six of whom died in a car bombing attack in Tikrit , the hometown of former President Hussein . Under such circumstances , Allawi admitted frankly that it would be impossible for some areas in Iraq to participate in this month 's election .
In the meantime , another two car bombing attacks took place today in Mosul in Iraq , leaving at least two Iraqi soldiers dead .
US Army Sergeant Schaeffer told AFP that a van exploded in an attempt to attack on a joint convoy of US and Iraqi military vehicles , killing an unidentified number of civilians .
Schaeffer said another car parked across the street exploded and killed two Iraqi soldiers .
US Trade Deficit in November Hit US $ 60 Billion , Setting Highest Record in History
US Department of Commerce announced data today that US exports shrank 2.3 % in November last year , driving trade deficit to a new historic high of US $ 60.3 billion .
While US exports plummeted to a new five-month low of only US $ 95.6 billion , imports grew 1.3 % to a new all time high of US $ 155.8 billion as the bill for US oil imports increased by 1.3 % , or more than US $ 2 billion to US $ 14.2 billion .
Trade deficit increased 7.7 % from the adjusted US $ 56 billion in October last year , a dramatic increase of 50.8 % from the US $ 40 billion in November 2003 .
According to a survey conducted by CBS MarketWatch , Wall Street economists predicted the trade deficit on goods and services will shrink to about US $ 53.3 billion .
Although a weaker dollar makes US products relatively cheaper both at home and abroad , the US trade deficit continues to widen .
The report by the Department of Commerce today will put pressure on the US dollar and renew calls for Washington to do something about the US energy independence and the trade imbalance with China .
US exports slipped last November due to a decrease of US $ 1.4 billion in capital goods exports , including a US $ 325-million drop in aircraft and aircraft engines exports .
Exports of industrial materials , mainly energy , fell by US $ 800 million .
Exports of automobiles , consumer goods , and food also declined .
Japan Defense Agency Chief : Will Not Forget Militarist Past and Will Respect the Dignity of Neighboring Countries
Japan Defense Agency Chief Yoshinori Ono said today that Japan will not forget its militarist past and will carefully keep in mind the " dignity " of neighboring countries as it takes a higher international profile .
Asked about possible concern over Japan 's dispatch of its Self-Defense Forces to areas hit by South Asian tsunamis , Ono said : " When we get along with Southeast Asian countries , we should never forget " the past .
He told reporters : " We must build a relationship with our friendly neighbors , which allows us to tell them we mean well .
Looking back on the past , we should fully respect the dignity of other countries . "
Noting this year marks the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II , Ono said : " We hope to be reborn and will cooperate for the new era . "
Ono has just concluded his tour of several countries hit by South Asian tsunamis . He said he could feel the " dignity " of an independent country when the Indonesian leader told him Japan 's Self-Defense Forces should complete their relief mission by the end of March at the latest .
The United Nations has expressed concern over the deadline the Indonesian government imposed on foreign troops .
Foreign troops were well credited for delivering relief to tsunami survivors in the most remote areas .
Nearly 1,000 Japan 's SDF troops are on their way to the countries hit by the December 26 tsunami , a natural catastrophe that killed more than 163,000 people .
This is the largest deployment of Japan 's Self-Defense Forces since the end of World War II .
The US-directed Japanese postwar constitution stipulates that the Self-Defense Forces cannot use force .
Controversy Broke out in Japan 's Media over Alleged Political Interference in NHK Program
The allegation that the public Japan Broadcasting Corp ( NHK ) was pressured by politicians to delete part of a program on Japan 's military draft of women as sex slaves during World War II a few years ago has pitted liberal Japanese media against their conservative counterparts .
It was alleged that NHK took out most portions of interviews after its discussion with top political leaders . Liberal media criticized NHK for what it did since the majority of those interviewed were critics of Japan 's wartime conduct and victims of forced sex slavery .
However , conservative newspapers defended NHK 's decision to edit the program , believing the company 's senior executives were obligated to ensure the fairness of the program content .
The controversy broke out last week over a program aired in 2001 that featured a mock trial on the crime the Japanese military committed in drafting women as sex slaves .
The trial , held by a women 's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000 , found late Japanese Emperor Hirohito guilty because he allowed Japanese military to draft women as sex slaves during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries .
Historian said at least 200,000 young women were forced to serve as sex slaves in frontline Japanese military brothels during the war . They were mostly from South Korea but some of them also came from Taiwan , China , Philippines and Indonesia .
The program producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th to disclose the fact that right before the program was aired , NHK senior officials had met with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa , who had expressed concern over the program .
According to Nagai , NHK senior officials later re-edited and shortened the program .
He said : " NHK bowed to political pressures . "
Abe and Nakagawa admitted meeting with NHK officials and telling them to be " fair " but strongly denied pressuring the company .
Eurozone Data to Show Core Inflation under Control
Economists said today that eurozone economic data to be released this week will show core inflation is still under control .
In the meantime , eurozone industrial production and French consumer spending are both expected to decline .
The Eurostat is expected to confirm that inflation rate will rise slightly from 2.2 % in November to 2.3 % in December when it releases inflation data on the 20th of this month .
However , the increase is mainly a reflection of tobacco tax increases , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 % .
Core inflation figures will be released together with consumer prices figures .
Economists pointed out that core inflation , which excludes prices of food , energy , tobacco and alcohol , has stayed at the range of 1.6 % and 2 % for the past two years .
European Central Bank President Trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have diminished recently .
Although inflation will remain above 2 % for the coming few months , it may decline by the end of the year .
Meanwhile , another economist said that given the slowing growth in Germany , eurozone industrial output expectations for November to be released on the 18th are also expected to decline .
German industrial output declined 1.7 % in November , while a survey of economists conducted by AFP 's subsidiary AFX News shows that eurozone industrial output will fall again by 0.4 % in November after a drop of 0.5 % in October .
Schmieding of Bank of America said that a rebound in eurozone industrial output expectations is likely in December .
Tsunami Victims Hit Anew , This Time by Bureaucracy
Three weeks after suffering the strongest tsunami attacks in history , survivors are now grappling with the vices of bureaucracy and politicization , while the world 's focus has shifted elsewhere .
Thousands of decaying bodies continue to be dug out from debris , pushing the death toll of the December 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 168,000 . In the meantime , the upcoming Iraqi presidential elections and Bush 's inauguration ceremony have replaced the tsunami disaster as the world media 's top headline news .
Indonesia has retracted its original demand that foreign troops involved in humanitarian aid missions withdraw within three months .
In Thailand , leaders from Canada , Sweden , Norway , and Finland are discussing reconstruction and efforts to identify dead bodies .
However , survivors are facing new difficulties , such as Indonesia 's deep-rooted bureaucracy , which has impeded the distribution of relief supplies pouring in from all over the world .
In a small village near Banda Aceh , capital of Aceh Province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra , fisherman Busriadi said : " It seems like we do not even exist . The tsunami hit us very hard . We have lost everything and we are starving . "
He said : " Where are the food , clothing , and other relief supplies we saw on TV pouring into Aceh ? "
Like thousands of other disaster victims , Busriadi lost his identity card and other official documents due to the tsunami , which turned his efforts to get relief supplies into a nightmare .
Although he has been begging officials and shuttling daily from one place to another to process paperwork , the result is always the same : no relief aid for him .
Zeng Qinghong Said to Have Visited Zhao Ziyang before His Death
The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy in China said that before ousted former CPC Secretary General Zhao Ziyang died of illness this morning , China 's Vice President Zeng Qinghong visited him in the hospital .
The Information Center said that according to Zhao Ziyang 's family , Zeng Qinghong visited him at 6 : 00 this morning in a Beijing hospital before his death about an hour later . Zhao was 85 .
Formerly CPC secretary general and premier , Zhao Ziyang was ousted because he opposed the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement in 1989 . He had been under house arrest since then and had lost favor within the government .
The Information Center said that according to Zhao 's family , Wen Jiabao , incumbent premier who used to work under Zhao Ziyang , did not come to visit him when he was critically ill .
However , before Zhao Ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th , he was visited by Tian Jiyun , the retired Party Central Committee member who once worked as his assistant .
The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy in China has been in regular contact with the Zhao family and has released accurate information about Zhao Ziyang at opportune times for many years .
The Information Center said that some twenty key retired officials from the Party , the government , and the military plan to issue a public letter to the CPC calling for a reevaluation of Zhao Ziyang 's contributions and demanding a public memorial service for him .
The Center added that Zhao Ziyang 's family will not receive permission to host or prepare a funeral . The final decision on relevant arrangements will be made by the Party .
Liang Boqi , Zhao Ziyang 's wife , is 86 .
The Information Center said that due to her poor health , she was not informed of her husband 's death until the evening .
China Widely Urged to Push for Democracy in the Wake of Zhao Ziyang 's Death
While the world lavished praise on former CPC leader Zhao Ziyang after his death from illness today , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , the Taiwan government , and overseas Chinese democracy campaigners all urged Beijing to push for democratic reforms envisioned by Zhao Ziyang .
Ousted in 1989 for his opposition toward the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement , Zhao Ziyang spent the rest of his life under house arrest and passed away in a Beijing hospital this morning . He was 85 .
According to Jiji Press , Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi said in memory of Zhao Ziyang : " I hope they ( China ) make efforts toward democratization . "
Taiwan also urged China to push for democracy and political reforms after the death of Zhao Ziyang .
Overseas Chinese democracy campaigners praised Zhao Ziyang as " one of the greatest reformers in China " who sacrificed his political life in opposing the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement .
Lian Shengde , president of the New York-based Free China Movement and former student movement leader , said : " During the 15 years of his house arrest , he openly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward rule of law and democracy .
Zhao Ziyang will be fondly remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a man of principle . "
Some democracy activists are demanding that the Chinese government hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and make a fair evaluation of his contributions .
However , they admit the unlikelihood of Zhao Ziyang receiving such treatment because of Chinese government 's fears that a public dissatisfied with the CPC ruling will take advantage of the occasion to create unrest .
As it was , the 1989 student movement was triggered by the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang .
A brief report released by Xinhua News Agency today that Comrade Zhao Ziyang had died of illness in Beijing was the only related official statement .
UN : Rich Nations Fail to Honor Pledge to Reduce Poverty
A panel of UN-appointed experts said in a new report that the rich nations that promised to deliver financial aid to halve extreme poverty worldwide by 2015 have so far failed to honor their pledge .
Wealthy nations around the world have promised to participate in " Millennium Development Goals , " an ambitious UN program , to improve the lot of the world 's poor and suffering .
However , as more than one billion people worldwide are living on less than a dollar a day , and 2.7 billion more are surviving on less than two dollars a day , the UN experts said there isn 't much time left for rich nations to live up to their promises .
Director Brown of the UN Development Program said : " With the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achievable . "
The UN experts said that 22 rich nations worldwide pledged to provide 0.7 % of their gross national product in aid to the developing countries , but they have so far only provided 0.25 % .
UN Secretary General Annan commissioned the development experts led by former Harvard economist Sachsthe to compile this progress report on meeting the goals , which include wiping out extreme poverty , making primary education universal , cutting child mortality rate , and fighting AIDS and other deadly diseases .
The report said : " The practical solutions exist . The political framework is established . And for the first time , the cost is affordable . All that is needed now is action . "
A Global Disaster Warning System to Be Set up , UN Announces
The United Nations announced that a global disaster warning system will be set up to prevent major natural disasters .
However , after South Asia 's massive tsunami tragedy , there are still differences on which country 's technology is to be used for this disaster warning system .
In a joint statement issued after a global conference in Kobe , Japan , several UN agencies said that UN experts will establish a global disaster warning system to reduce damages caused by major natural disasters .
The severe damages caused by South Asia 's massive tsunamis infuriated all the Indian Ocean nations .
Director Briceno of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction said : " The new program will bring peace and safety to mankind .
An effective early warning system will ensure the lives and safety of millions of people in all parts of the world . "
However , this UN statement is largely symbolic only .
A UNESCO official said that many more important talks are needed on this disaster warning system .
The UNESCO is spearheading the establishment of a global disaster warning system .
Bernal , head of UNESCO 's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission , said : " At present , several countries have made different proposals . So we need to make coordination and cooperation efforts . "
Bernal said the Commission will hold two meetings within 60 days , which hopefully can decide on one of the proposals about the tsunami warning system .
One of the meetings is to be held in Paris , while the location for the other meeting has not yet been decided .
Bernal hopes that a decision can be reached in July . This global disaster warning system will be completed and put into operation by mid-2006 , also the target timeline set by the UNESCO .
Beijing 's HIV Cases Rise 40 % Annually
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 1 ( Reporters Zhao Xinpei and Li Xu ) Beijing Municipal Health Bureau recently released its latest statistics on HIV infections in Beijing : From 1985 to October 2004 , Beijing reported a cumulative 2,046 cases of HIV infection , with an average annual increase of 40.6 % .
According to national AIDS statistics , Beijing ranks 8th in the country in number of reported HIV cases .
Of the 2,046 HIV cases , 403 are Beijing residents , 1,507 are non-resident migrants , 106 are foreign nationals , and 30 are people with unidentified addresses .
According to analysis , AIDS infection in Beijing is mainly caused by intravenous drug abuse and sexual transmission . AIDS infection within the migrant population is mainly caused by intravenous drug abuse and blood selling , while AIDS infection among foreign nationals is mainly sexually transmitted .
Since July 2004 , in order to prevent AIDS from spreading further , disease prevention and control centers in 18 districts and counties in Beijing Municipality have set up free AIDS consultation rooms and anti-body screening labs to conduct face-to-face consultations , preliminary blood screening , and epidemic surveys . This practice will be gradually expanded to all hospitals above level 2 in the municipality .
Beijing Municipal Health Bureau has tapped Ditan Hospital and You 'an Hospital as Beijing 's designated hospitals for free AIDS treatment , responsible for the clinical part of treatment . Beijing Municipal Health Bureau and the Municipal Finance Bureau organize and integrate all purchases of necessary drugs and testing agents .
The Beijing Municipal Education Commission has researched and formulated a policy of free education for HIV-infected patients and their children and a school attendance policy for the HIV-infected among young students .
At present , Beijing hospitals above level 2 with OB-GYN departments are responsible for providing free AIDS consultations and screening , while Ditan Hospital and You 'an Hospital perform anti-viral medical treatment for pregnant women .
At present , 1,390 condom vending machines have been installed free of charge in some areas ; methadone maintenance treatment is provided for intravenous drug abusers , and trial locations for clean syringe exchange have also been established .
Shanghai Tops World in Power Generation Equipment Output and Production Capacity
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , December 1 ( Reporter Jiang Wei ) As trial operations were completed for a 660-MW generating unit , Shanghai Turbine Generator Co . , Ltd . , a subsidiary of Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group ( SECPG ) , on the 1st of this month fulfilled ahead of time its annual generator production capacity target of 15,000 MW , helping Shanghai to rank first in the world in both power station equipment output and production capacity , a dream come true for generations of workers in China 's equipment manufacturing industry .
SECPG is China 's largest power station equipment manufacturer .
As the demand for power generation equipment has soared in China in recent years , the country 's power generator manufacturers have entered the stage of high growth and major development .
Integrating its superior resources in power station equipment such as turbine generators and power station boilers , SECPG obtained a production order for nine large-sized gas-fired generating units and three exhaust-heat boilers in a general bid , after taking an order for four 1,000-MW fuel-fired generating units .
In the meantime , it further enhanced its corporate management , technological development , and production efficiency through integrated operations .
At present , SECPG commands 40 % of the market in China 's power station equipment industry , and continues to develop overseas markets in the Middle East , Southeast Asia , South America , and other regions .
This year alone , Shanghai Turbine Generator Co . , Ltd . , manufacturing principal components for power generation equipment , has taken in sales orders worth 6 billion yuan .
SECPG President Zheng Jianhua said that the " power shortage " this summer triggered a dramatic nationwide increase in the demand for power station equipment , dramatically intensifying market competition for manufacturing power station equipment .
The Group is now working toward its three major goals of " researching , developing , and manufacturing 1,000-MW fuel-fired generators , gas-fired turbine generating units , and 1,000-MW nuclear power generators " in an effort to be ranked in the Global Fortune 500 as soon as possible .
( Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan ) Hong Kong Observatory Provides New Services for WMO Websites
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , December 2 Beginning on the 2nd of this month , Hong Kong Observatory will provide two new services for the websites of " World Weather Information Service " and " Severe Weather Information Center " managed by the World Meteorological Organization .
The observatory spokesperson said the two new services are : adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the WWIS website and adding a recap function to display the tropical cyclone tracks of the past seven days to the SWIC website .
These two services represent Hong Kong Observatory 's provision of yet another new service after it provided the global heavy rain ( including snow ) official observation data to the SWIC at the beginning of this year .
It is learned that the WWIS website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for major world cities .
The new service provides , for the first time , global official weather observations with a global map of cloudiness and rain as a pilot program .
The new web page has a wide and intensive coverage of weather observation data and is updated regularly eight times a day .
The new product at the SWIC website provides a recap function for the tropical cyclone tracks .
In the previous design , the original locations and other information of each tropical cyclone were no longer saved on the website once it had dissipated .
However , there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about the tropical cyclone several days after it has made landfall .
Therefore , the new product saves the information on the intensities , locations and tracks of all tropical cyclones that have occurred in the past seven days , allowing the public and the media to retrieve the needed information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated .
World 's First Quick Diagnostic Kit for Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Developed in Shantou
Xinhua News Agency , Shantou , December 3 ( Zhang Siwen and Lin Junqiang ) Reporters learned that the Joint Influenza Research Center , partnering the medical schools of Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong , has developed the world 's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus H5N1 , following its nearly six months of work with Xiamen University .
Using this quick testing method to test a suspected case specimen can produce a conclusion about bird flu infection in as fast as one hour .
According to an introduction given by Professor Guan Yi , head of the Joint Influenza Research Center of the Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong medical schools , the highly pathogenic and deadly bird flu actually has a much higher mortality rate than the SARS virus , based on current available data .
Previously it took at least three to five days , and at times more than one week , to confirm the diagnosis of a " suspected " case of the virus .
This successfully developed quick technique for bird flu virus testing uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a gold-based dipstick . Specimens able to be tested include excretions , nasal or throat secretions , whole or split virus cultured in a chicken embryo , and serums . A conclusion about bird flu infection can be reached in as fast as one hour , and at most within two hours .
The new technique is simple , convenient , and fast . The test can be performed at the site of an outbreak with over 90 % accuracy . It can aid the early detection , diagnosis , quarantine , and treatment of the infectious virus , and thereby prevent widespread outbreak and consequent heavy casualties .
Entrusted by China 's Center of Disease Prevention and Control , the Joint Influenza Research Center of the Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong medical schools recently held a training workshop on bird flu virus testing and trained staff from centers of disease prevention and control in 20 provinces and cities throughout the country . This latest bird flu quick testing technique was included as part of the program .
Spokesperson for Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong Expresses Great Dissatisfaction with Speech of Hyde , Chairman of US House Committee on International Relations
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , December 3 A spokesperson for the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong spoke on the 3rd to express great dissatisfaction with the recent speech in Hong Kong by Hyde , chairman of the US House Committee on International Relations .
The spokesperson expressed strong dissatisfaction with the speech delivered on the 2nd in Hong Kong by Hyde , chairman of the US House Committee on International Relations , for his vicious attacks on development and progress in China and his Cold War-style defiling of China 's foreign policy .
The spokesperson said it is commonly known that China 's development not only serves the basic interests of the 1.3 billion Chinese people , but also supports worldwide prosperity and development .
On the international stage , China is a responsible nation and has played an active and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability .
On the issue of nuclear nonproliferation , China has always strictly observed relevant international conventions and firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form . China maintains that such issues should be resolved through negotiation , dialogue , and strengthened international monitoring .
The spokesperson said that while China-US relations are making healthy and steady progress , it was regretful that Mr. Hyde ignored objective facts and made these extremely irresponsible remarks . These remarks , totally inconsistent with consensus on the development of bilateral relations reached by Chinese and US presidents recently , run counter to the mainstream voice of the US community for strengthened cooperation with China and are undoubtedly harmful to the development of the China-US relationship .
China 's Largest Seawater Desalinization Project to Be Built in Zhoushan
Xinhua News Agency , Hangzhou , December 6 ( Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun ) The largest-ever mainland seawater desalinization project , with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons , is to be built in Putuo District of Zhoushan City , Zhejiang Province .
For Zhoushan residents , who have long suffered from water shortage , the seawater that has surged around them for thousands of years will soon be turned into fresh , sweet running water flowing into tens of thousands of households .
Reporters learned from relevant departments that the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center under the State Oceanic Administration and Liuheng Township Government of Putuo District , Zhoushan City have recently signed a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalinization project with daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons .
With daily production of 10,000 tons of fresh water , the 50-million-yuan seawater desalinization project would have the mainland 's largest treatment capacity so far . The project 's first phase is expected to be completed by next year .
Zhoushan is one of the cities in China with serious water shortages .
There are 1,390 islands of various sizes within the city . Fresh water per capita is 601 cubic meters , which is only 25.4 % of the average fresh water per capita in Zhejiang Province . Water supply has always been a problem in the life of this island city 's residents .
In Putuo District 's Liuheng Township for example , 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped daily from a neighboring town at the cost of more than ten yuan per ton .
The reverse osmosis seawater desalinization technology developed by the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center under the State Oceanic Administration is a pressure-driven membrane separation process , currently a hot subject in international seawater desalinization research .
The relevant authority at the center said that through technological improvement and by retrofitting domestic-made equipment , both the costs of the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization project and its energy consumption have been reduced .
The cost of seawater desalinization treatment has been further reduced from 5 yuan per ton .
This reduction indicates that the cost of seawater desalinization may be expected to approach the prices of running water and industrial water .
( International ) Hungary 's Referendum on the 5th Invalidated
Xinhua News Agency , Budapest , December 5 ( Reporter Liu Weimin ) On the 5th , Hungary held a national referendum on the issues of privatization of national public medical institutions , and of dual citizenship for overseas ethnic Hungarians .
Since both the number of participating voters and the number of voters for or against the two issues failed to reach percentages set by law , results of this referendum were invalidated .
Statistical results based on 99.91 % of the vote , as calculated by Hungary 's National Electoral Office in the late evening of the 5th , showed that 3.011 million people , accounting for 37.48 % of total voters in the country , participated in the voting .
Among them , 1.919 million and 1.033 million voted for and against the first issue , respectively , accounting for 23.87 % and 12.85 % of eligible voters in the country . 1.518 million and 1.426 million voted for and against the second issue , respectively , accounting for 18.88 % and 17.75 % of eligible voters in the country .
According to relevant Hungarian laws , only when the number of participating voters exceeds 50 % of eligible voters in the country , or when the number of voters for or against the above issues exceeds 25 % of eligible voters in the country , will the result of the referendum be valid .
Previously , the Hungarian government and the ruling party had been calling for people to vote against the aforementioned two issues , while the opposition party had been urging people to vote in favor .
It is reported that this referendum had the lowest voter turnout of all referendums and elections to date .
Following release of the voting results , Hungarian Prime Minister Gyurcsany made a speech acknowledging the failure of this referendum .
He said the government will be more active in developing ethnic policies and conducting healthcare reform .
On the other hand , Orban , chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats , Hungary 's largest opposition party , said the referendum was beneficial even if the number of voters in favor did not reach the required percentage .
He urged the government and parliament to consider the results of this referendum while developing related legislation .

( International ) Special Summit of the Andean Presidential Council Held in Peru
Xinhua News Agency , Cusco ( Peru ) December 7 ( Reporters Liu Guoqiang and Wang Lu ) The Special Summit of the Presidential Council of the Andean Community ( CAN ) opened on the 7th in Cusco , a famous tourist city in Peru .
Participating presidents or their representatives will discuss such issues as deepening integration in the Andean region and promoting economic and social development .
Peruvian President Toledo said at the summit 's opening ceremony that although the Andean Community has been established for 35 years , some major issues such as poverty have still not yet been resolved .
Currently , poverty rates in the Andean region are as high as 53 % , posing a serious threat to democratic administration in the region .
All governments in the Andean Community must therefore try hard to establish effective poverty reduction mechanisms and to increase levels of public participation in state affairs , so as to promote social stability and development .
Toledo said that although there are many issues within the Andean Community that need to be resolved , great progress has been made in Latin American integration in recent years . The establishment of the South American Community of Nations will be declared at the Third South American Presidential Summit to be held here on the 8th .
He said he believed the establishment of this new regional organization will play an important role in promoting political , economic , and social development in the region .
In addition to Toledo , Bolivian President Mesa also attended the meeting .
Colombian President Uribe , Ecuadorian President Gutierrez , and Venezuelan President Chavez were unable to attend the meeting for various reasons , but they will come to attend the Third South American Presidential Summit to be held here on the 8th .
Established in 1969 , the Andean Community is composed of five countries , namely Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Venezuela , and Peru . It is a regional organization through which Latin American countries promote economic cooperation . The Community is headquartered in the Peruvian capital of Lima .
The Presidential Council is the highest-level decision-making body of the Andean Community and holds a meeting every year .
The last meeting was held in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito in July 2003 .
Construction of Three Gorges Project Underground Power Station to Begin Soon
Xinhua News Agency , Wuhan , December 8 ( Reporter Shi Yongfeng ) On December 8 , the first public bidding was held for the principal part of the Yangtze Three Gorges Project underground power station , kicking off construction of the Three Gorges underground power station .
The Three Gorges Project design calls for the installation of 26 700-MW water turbine generating units , for a combined capacity of 18,200-MW , which upon completion will generate 84.7 billion kWh of electricity annually .
In order to further tap the power generation potential of the Three Gorges Project , the preliminary design of the Project reserved space for expanding the underground power station .
According to an executive with China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation , the Three Gorges underground power station is to be set in the mountain on the right bank of the Three Gorges Dam , with its principal construction including intake tower , diversion tunnel , principal plant building , tailrace system , bus shaft , and 500kV transformer substation .
Six 700-MW generating units will be installed in the underground power station .
Thus , the total number of generating units installed in the Three Gorges Project will be increased from the originally planned 26 to 32 , while installed generation capacity will rise to 22,400-MW from 18,200-MW , significantly boosting the Three Gorges Project power generation capacity .
Flood control was the primary objective for construction of the Three Gorges Project .
According to the Three Gorges Reservoir operation coordination plan , the water level of the reservoir will be lowered from the normal pool level of 175 meters to the flood control level of 145 meters prior to the annual flood season .
Therefore , construction of the underground power station will increase water utilization in the Three Gorges Reservoir , reduce the amount of unused water , and enhance power generation capacity , maximizing the periods of peak calibration when no water goes unused .
Currently , groundbreaking has already started for the branch tube , the tailrace , the support structure , and other preliminary projects for construction of the Three Gorges underground power station .
Sources said that the underground power station will be completed and put into operation by the end of 2008 .
China Ready to Establish A Sailing Festival
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 8 ( Reporter Huang Fuhui ) Yao Mingde , chairman of the China Road Transport Association , said at a press conference held here on the 8th that he is " full of confidence " for establishing a China Sailing Festival .
Yao Mingde , who also heads the organizing taskforce office for commemorating the 600th anniversary of Zheng He 's Western seas voyage , said that 16 member departments of the organizing taskforce , including the Ministry of Communications , have reached consensus on establishing July 11 of each year , the day Zheng He made his first Western seas voyage , as China 's Sailing Festival , and will make a proposal to the State for establishing this festival .
Sources said the State Council approval is needed to establish non-holiday festivals .
Zheng He was a world-renowned navigator .
During the 28 years from 1405 to 1433 , Zheng He led a fleet of more than 200 ships and nearly 30,000 people on a succession of seven long sea voyages , sailing through Southeast Asia , the Indian Ocean to arrive at the Red Sea and Africa . His journey covered over 300,000 kilometers and included stops in more than 30 countries and regions in Asia and Africa .
China will host a series of events next year to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He 's Western seas voyages .
The logo for the commemorative events was revealed in Beijing on the 8th .
The logo comprises a sailboat braving the wind and waves as it sails west , a light blue billowy arching wave , and the text " 600th Anniversary of Zheng He 's Western Seas Voyage ( 1405-2005 ) . "
It was designed by Yao Ying , an art teacher in a junior high school in Xi 'an , Shaanxi Province .
People from all walks of life have urged that a China Sailing Festival be established in 2005 to coincide with the 600th anniversary of Zheng He 's Western seas voyage , and to use the opportunity to educate youngsters , thus enhancing public awareness of sailing and maritime concepts , passing down the spirit of the Chinese nation , and deepening patriotic education .
Yao Mingde said that China has over 3 million square meters of sea territory and that 90 % of China 's goods in the international trade is transported by sea .
As China is one of the world 's large maritime nations , lack of a sailing festival among its various holidays does not make sense .
Taiwan Province has already established July 11 as Sailing Festival day .
Sailing festivals are celebrated in about a dozen nations throughout the world , including the United States , Canada , and Japan .

On behalf of the African Union , Mbeki paid a four-day visit to Cote d 'Ivoire from the 2nd to the 6th of this month , seeking to develop a plan to resolve the crisis there .
At the conclusion of his visit , Mbeki announced that all parties in Cote d 'Ivoire had reached consensus on four proposals .
The proposals include completing the relevant legislation of the Marcoussis Agreement , starting a process for disarming combat personnel , returning all government ministers to their posts to take their duties , and restoring Cote d 'Ivoire 's domestic security .
The Ivorian parliamentary caucus chairman recently held a meeting and decided that Parliament will start reviewing the draft for constitutional reforms on the 10th .
Ivorian opposition rebels also announced on the 8th that opposition leaders will hold a meeting in the coming days to evaluate the overall peace process and to discuss the issue of disarmament .
In September 2002 , a coup and civil war broke out in Cote d 'Ivoire .
In January last year and July of this year , major Ivorian political parties and representatives of opposition rebels reached agreements in France and Ghana , respectively , to restore peace and carry out national reconciliation .
However , implementation of the agreements suffered numerous setbacks , repeatedly stalling the peace process .
Opposition rebels , who control the northern part of Cote d 'Ivoire , recalled their government representatives in mid-October , leaving the country 's peace process in another deadlock .
The situation in Cote d 'Ivoire further worsened in early November when the Ivorian government army had a serious clash with French troops stationed in the country .

Xinhua News Agency , Nanning , December 11 ( Reporter Wang Mian ) On December 11 , the old revolutionary base of Baise , population 3.6 million , commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Baise Uprising with a series of activities .
On December 11 , 1929 , Deng Xiaoping , Zhang Yunyi , and others launched and directed the famous Baise Uprising and founded the revolutionary base of Youjiang and the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army .
The Baise Uprising , following the Nanchang Uprising , the Autumn Harvest Uprising , and the Guangzhou Uprising , was yet another successful armed uprising led independently by the Communist Party .
On the morning of December 11 , more than 2,000 people holding fresh flowers came to the Baise Uprising Monument to lay their flowers , bow in respect , and reminisce upon the martyrs ' great achievements .
After that , they watched the movie " Baise Uprising " and toured the photo and picture exhibit " Zhang Yunyi in Guangxi , " in addition to other activities .
Huang Qunsheng , a student of Baise High School , said : " Although we are frequently told a lot about patriotism and collectivism in our history classes and social and political science classes , we feel that today 's actual on-site visit has given us a vivid lesson about patriotism . "
Since this year 's centennial birthday celebration of Deng Xiaoping , the old revolutionary base of Baise has made a series of improvements to this foundation of patriotic education , including renovating the Baise Uprising Museum facilities , constructing a garden of stone tablets engraved with Deng Xiaoping 's handwriting , and preserving the Yuedong Guildhall , the original headquarters site of the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army .

Experts Propose Establishing a Media Spokesperson System for Chinese Youth
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , December 13 ( Reporter Liu Dan ) The " China Youth Social Education Forum 2004 : Media and Development of Minors , " which concluded in Shanghai on the 13th , proposed that China should establish a media spokesperson system regarding the status of minors , and regularly release information on existing problems and current development of the youth population .
Relevant agencies in Shanghai recently conducted a survey showing that a minor spends an average of 1.17 hours per day doing extracurricular reading , 1.05 hours watching TV , 0.99 hours surfing the Internet , etc . About half of a minor 's free time is spent in a media environment , which , as an entirely new social force , is becoming an indismissible factor in shaping the growth and development of the youth population .
" Media is a window that links the minds of youth with the outside world . When the window is open , fresh air comes in along with flies and mosquitoes . "
Chen Tianqiao , chairman of the board of Shanghai Shanda Networking Development Co . , Ltd. said .
While media creates a good condition for the healthy growth of minors , opinions expressed in the media , due to market competition , demand for profits , and the poor nature of some media professionals , tend to mislead youngsters ' thoughts and values . Some media even go further by serving as channels for violence and pornography .
At present , China has over 2,000 TV channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies . There are 1,868 broadcast programs , and nationwide , as many as 87 million netizens .
Relevant authorities at the forum said that establishing a media spokesperson system for minors could provide authoritative survey data on the current status and problems regarding youth development , change the present situation where the media " send wrong messages , " and ensure a healthy and beneficial media environment for young people 's growth .
( International ) Iraqi Foreign Minister Thinks Iraqi Elections Face Three Major Challenges
Xinhua News Agency , Dubai ( the UAE ) , December 14 ( Reporters Xing Xudong and Yan Yi ) Foreign Minister Zebari of the interim Iraqi government said on the 14th in Dubai that the Iraqi elections set for January 30 next year will face three major challenges , namely a deteriorating security situation impeding and interfering with the election process ; a turnout affected by voters too scared of terrorist attacks to vote ; and ensuring to the largest extent possible transparency and fairness of the elections .
Zebari said in a speech at the Arab Strategy Forum in Dubai that it is essential for Iraq to hold elections as scheduled because the elections can not only determine a new Iraqi leadership but also ensure that Iraq is a free , democratic , and unified country belonging to the entire Iraqi people .
He said he believed that the future Iraqi government will be a legitimate government representing the Iraqi people and expressing their wishes .
Zebari said it is at Iraq 's request that US-led coalition forces are staying in Iraq to provide protection , because the current interim Iraqi government cannot control the security situation and is in no position to round up terrorists and saboteurs .
The coalition forces ' stay is provisional and will , according to the UN resolution , come to an end when Iraq consummates its political processes and forms a legitimate government .
Zebari stressed that the new Iraq will continue to maintain its Arab and Islamic character and will abide by the charter of the League of Arab States .
The Iraqi people are faced with a historic opportunity to rebuild their country on a new foundation . Iraq will rise anew and become a major member in the big Arab family capable of contributing to its own nation .

( International ) Worldwide Drug-related Deaths Will Increase in 2005 , UN Warns
Xinhua News Agency , Vienna , December 17 ( Reporter Song Guocheng ) Costa , executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased production of heroin in Afghanistan , the expected price stability and enhanced purity of heroin in the global black market in 2005 will result in more drug-related deaths .
Costa has already sent warnings to health and anti-drug agency officials in Europe and neighboring countries , urging these nations to closely watch new developments in Afghan opium cultivation and international drug crimes , and to take corresponding prevention measures .
According to statistical data provided by the Vienna-based UNODC , the production of heroin in Afghanistan dropped by 94 % when opium cultivation was banned there in 2001 . The following year , the purity of heroin on the European black market declined by 50 % .
From 2000 to 2002 , the number of drug-related deaths in Europe decreased by 20 % .
Costa said that compared with 2003 , the area of opium cultivation in Afghanistan this year has increased by 64 % . The production of heroin reached more than 500 tons , more than the total amount transacted in the global heroin black market in a year . This trend indicates an increase in the purity of drugs worldwide and a commensurate increase in the number of drug-related deaths .
Costa thinks that the source of drugs in Afghanistan constitutes a " clear and realistic threat " to global anti-drug efforts , and that the increased supply of black market heroin is a " death sentence " for drug abusers .
It is estimated that there are about 100,000 deaths from drug overdose worldwide each year .
( International ) US Military Confirmed Another Guantanamo Prisoner as Non Enemy Combatant
Xinhua News Agency , Washington , December 20 ( Reporters Pan Yunzhao and Tan Xinmu ) Gordon England , navy secretary of the US Department of Defense , said at a press conference at the Pentagon on the 20th that a military review team has confirmed that a prisoner detained at the US navy base in Guantanamo was not an enemy combatant and will be released soon .
This is the second prisoner detained at Guantanamo who was identified by the US military as not being an enemy combatant .
England said the Pentagon verified the identity of this prisoner one or two days ago and that the State Department will notify the home country of the prisoner of this decision and make arrangements for his release .
However , he did not reveal the name and nationality of this prisoner nor did he explain under what circumstances he was captured .
England refused to admit that the Department of Defense made any mistake in verifying the identities of Guantanamo prisoners .
He said the military review team in charge of verifying the identities of Guantanamo prisoners has reviewed 507 prisoners and confirmed the identities of 230 , of whom 228 were proved to be enemy combatants .
The United States has so far released about 200 Guantanamo prisoners . Some of them were freed after they were deported to their own countries , while a few of them continued to be detained after they returned to their countries . At least twelve , however , again joined in attacking the US troops after being freed .
Currently some 550 " al-Qaeda " and Taliban suspects are detained in the US navy base in Guantanamo . Most of them were captured during the US war on Afghanistan .
The US government claimed these people are enemy combatants instead of war prisoners and are therefore not entitled to the protection under " Geneva Convention . "
Many countries criticized the US government for detaining their nationals indefinitely , while some international organizations also criticized what the US government did as violation of the international law .
Shanghai Chosen for ccTLD Node
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , December 21 ( Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu ) On the 21st , the China Internet Network Information Center ( CNNIC ) and Shanghai Information Industry ( Group ) Co . , Ltd. signed an agreement on a Shanghai node for country code top-level domain names .
Domain names form the communication basis of all Internet applications , including electronic commerce and administration , and are currently used extensively as Internet website addresses .
When people visit websites and receive and send emails , they first need to input domain names . Through Domain Name System analysis , domain names are converted to IP addresses , which lead to the web host for information transmission .
Domain Name Systems resemble a " nerve system " controlling information transmission on the Internet .
According to an introduction by Mao Wei , director of the CNNIC , which manages China 's ccTLD system , the number of netizens in China currently exceeds 90 million , ranking second in the world , and the number of websites in China has topped 650,000 .
Domain name analysis volume is in direct proportion to use of the Internet . With the Internet 's rapid development , the volume of domain name analysis has also grown rapidly .
At present , the number of registered CN domain names has reached 430,000 , and is growing by 10,000 each month .
The ccTLD server operated and managed by the CNNIC processes 380 million applications for domain name analysis daily at an average rate of more than 4,400 per second and over 8,000 at peak times .
Faced with rapid development of the Internet , the CNNIC , which administers and manages the registration of China 's domain names , this year reevaluated China 's four original ccTLD nodes and redeployed the CN TLD nodes according to the reevaluation analysis .
Based on the level of local Internet development and the quality of connection service provider software and hardware , Shanghai has been chosen as the ccTLD node .
Sources said that Shanghai currently hosts 45,000 CN domain names and that 26.6 % of its population have Internet access . Both Internet accessibility and application ranked first in the country .
The eastern China region around Shanghai , with a similarly advanced level of development , hosts 130,000 CN domain names and 230,000 websites .
Therefore , Shanghai has been selected as the first node in the redeployment plan .
China Has Become the World 's Largest Producer of Hard Alloy
Xinhua News Agency , Nanchang , December 22 ( Reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen ) In recent years China has seen rapid development in its hard alloy industry , with an annual output exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy production . In terms of production scale and capacity , China has become the largest producer of hard alloy in the world . Offering a full range of selection , China is capable of producing nearly all kinds of hard alloy products .
Reporters learned this information on the 22nd at the China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Forum currently underway .
Hard alloy , known as " industrial teeth , " is used to make cutting tools , high pressure tools , and mining and road construction machinery due to its extreme hardness and wear resistance . Hard alloy industry development plays an important role in the development of the entire tungsten industry .
Sources said that China 's hard alloy industry , beginning from scratch in the 1950s , has grown steadily toward its current status through remarkable achievements .
In the early 1980s when the annual worldwide hard alloy output was 25,000 tons , China produced about 5,000 tons of hard alloy per year . Entering the 21st century , annual global hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons , while China 's hard alloy production has soared to 15,000 tons , exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy output .
China has also made significant progress in exporting hard alloy .
In 1986 , China exported only 100 tons of hard alloy annually . By 2003 , exports had reached 2,500 tons . This year 's exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons , accounting for one third of hard alloy market transactions worldwide , similar to China 's share of total worldwide production . Foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports increased from less than US $ 4 million annually in the past to US $ 70 million today .
ADB Loan Supports Power Generation Using CBM and CMM in Shanxi
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 23 ( Reporter Jiang Guocheng ) The reporter learned on the 23rd from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) of the bank 's recent approval of a US $ 117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province fired by methane released from coal mining .
The CBM ( coal bed methane ) Development Demonstration Project will use the latest technology to increase production of CBM and CMM ( coal mine methane ) to provide fuel for the 120-MW power plant to be constructed .
According to the plans , the project will provide at least 166 million cubic meters of CBM annually to about 90,000 residential , industrial , and commercial customers upon its completion in 2008 .
It will benefit about 410,000 people in the area of Jincheng .
Shanxi 's coal output accounts for one third of the nation 's total .
The project 's total cost is estimated at US $ 237 million , of which US $ 20 million will be provided by a loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation , and US $ 37.86 million will be provided by a loan from China Construction Bank .
The Jincheng Municipal Government and two mining / industrial corporations in the area will provide a total of US $ 61.24 million in equity capital .
The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a US $ 500,000 grant for the project .
Methane recovered by drilling into a coal seam from the earth surface after completing construction of a mine well is called CBM , while methane released during underground coal mining operations is called CMM .
A highly explosive gas , methane must be removed in advance of coal mining operations to ensure a safe work environment .
Removing , collecting , and utilizing methane will reduce greenhouse emissions and help slow global warming and climatic change .
The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide .
Replacement of coal with methane can also increase clean fuel usage , improve coal mine efficiency , and improve air cleanness .
Hassing , an ADB senior project expert , said the project is expected to account for about 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gas emission reduction quotas .
( International ) Israel Museum 's Prized Possession Found to Be a Forgery
Xinhua News Agency , Jerusalem , December 24 James Snyder , director of the Israel Museum , said on the 24th that the museum 's prized possession , the ivory pomegranate , has recently been identified as a forgery .
This ivory pomegranate was once considered the only artifact ever discovered of the First Temple in Solomon 's time .
Snyder said in a statement that Israeli authorities conducted a meticulous examination on the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate .
Experts found it should be a relic of the Bronze period , dating back much earlier than the time of the First Jewish Temple .
A line of Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate read : " Belonging to the Temple of the Lord ( Yahweh ) , holy to the priests . "
However , the inscription was identified as being later added .
The Israel Museum bought the ivory pomegranate from an anonymous collector for US $ 550,000 in the 1980s .
Archeologists and artifact experts used to believe it was a treasure embedded by the First Temple priest in the top of a scepter and also the only relic left from that period of time .
Snyder said that prior to the purchase , the ivory pomegranate was authenticated by the Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and other experts .
According to the report by Israel 's newspaper Haaretz , Avigad ran a cursory examination of the relic using only a magnifying glass at that time .
Avigad himself denied this allegation .
In recent months , Israeli police uncovered three large-scale antiquity frauds in succession and questioned hundreds of people .
During the investigations , the police and the Antiquities Authority discovered by chance that the ivory pomegranate was a forgery .
The police will indict some of the parties involved next week .
In the 10th century B.C. , the Jewish King Solomon built the First Temple on today 's Temple Mount to store the sacred objects like the Ark of the Covenant and Noah 's ark , which were later destroyed .
Shenzhen to Mandate Use of " Reclaimed Water " in Some Complexes and Residential Subdistricts
Xinhua News Agency , Guangzhou , December 26 In a major effort toward building a " water-saving " city , Shenzhen will mandate the use of " reclaimed water " in some comparatively large complexes and residential subdistricts . Relevant guidelines and regulations on water reclamation design are currently being formulated .
" Reclaimed water " mainly refers to non-drinking water derived from treated urban waste water and domestic sewage , meeting certain water quality standards and reusable within a certain range .
Its quality is between that of running water and sewage .
In general it is used in large volume for flushing toilets , irrigating gardens and farmland , cleaning roads , washing cars , providing water for city fountains , and as supplementary water for cooling equipment .
According to an investigation by the Shenzhen Municipal Water Administration , more than 70 complexes in Shenzhen were equipped with " reclaimed water " recycling systems during the mid-1990s , but the construction firms had to abandon their use due to the high costs of recycling and utilizing " reclaimed water " associated with the technology , design , and management .
To put these pipelines into actual use , it needs only an additional investment of 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan to install a " reclaimed water " treatment system .
Based on daily usage of 500 tons of " reclaimed water " by each residential subdistrict , Shenzhen could save 35,000 tons of running water per day using the 70-plus existing sets of " reclaimed water " pipelines .
Sources said that Shenzhen 's " reclaimed water " recycling project will start with the renovation of the 70-plus complexes that were originally equipped with " reclaimed water " recycling systems . Further promotion will be based on assessment of feedbacks .
In the meantime , the Shenzhen Municipal Water Administration will work with city planning and construction departments to develop guidelines as soon as possible for water reclamation design and to mandate the use of " reclaimed water " in some comparatively large complexes .
The treated " reclaimed water " will be first used to irrigate urban greenery .

It is also reported that while talking about the reason why the auctioned Yugansk assets will not be incorporated into Gazprom 's corporate assets , Russia 's Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko said on the same day that it was largely because the State is already the major shareholder of Gazprom and does not want to add more to its controlling shares .
He said the Yugansk assets will be separated individually and transferred to a completely state-owned company .
On the 19th of this month , Russia 's Federal Property Fund held a public auction of 76.97 % equity of Yuganskneftegaz , the largest subsidiary of the oil firm Yukos . The newly organized Baikalfinansgroup won the bid with US $ 9.35 billion .
On the 22nd , the state-run Rosneft announced its acquisition of Baikalfinansgroup who won the bid for Yugansk shares and became the new owner of Yugansk shares .
Analysts think one important reason for Russia 's skillful operation of the Yugansk assets auction is to gain a dominant position in the related legal dispute .
In September this year , Russian President Putin had approved the merger of Gazprom with Rosneft .
Gazprom , established in February 1993 , is the largest natural gas producing company in the world .
The company controls 65 % of Russia 's natural gas reserve .
Last year the company 's natural gas output accounted for 93 % of Russia 's natural gas output and 20 % of the world 's natural gas output .
( Earthquakes , Tsunamis ) Fishing Industry Hit Hard by Tsunami in India 's Tamil Nadu State
Xinhua News Agency , Chennai ( India ) , December 31 ( Reporter Jiang Yaping ) The fishing industry in the southeast Indian state of Tamil Nadu was highly developed .
With a coastline 1,000 kilometers long , the state exported as many as 370,000 tons of seafood products every year , earning the local government 23 billion rupees ( one US dollar equals 43 rupees ) .
However , the extraordinarily massive tsunami triggered by a strong earthquake in the Indian Ocean on the 26th caused damage to the local fishing industry of unprecedented severity .
According to fishing industry authorities in Chennai , capital of Tamil Nadu state , the unexpected disaster had a huge effect on the state 's fishing industry .
As there was no early warning or caution , fishing boats were all moored in harbors and bays .
Consequently , more than 7,000 motor boats and over 30,000 barges , accounting for over 80 % of all boats in the state , were damaged in varying degrees . In addition , over 30,000 fishing nets were destroyed .
In an interview with this newspaper 's reporter , the head of the Fishery Association of Chennai said on the 31st that even if boats are repaired , fishermen won 't dare go to sea in the coming months because they had witnessed firsthand the devastation and cruelty of the ocean .
Some lost loved ones , while others suffered property damage . The horror in their minds will last for a long time .
It is estimated that the state 's fishing output in 2005 will drop by about 30 % from 2004 .
With the majority of its seaside fishing villages affected by the tsunami disaster on the 26th , the state of Tamil Nadu was the worst-hit region in India .
As of the 30th , more than 6,230 in the state had died , most of whom were fishermen .
Sources said that about 680,000 people in the state had been affected by the tsunami , 85 % of whom were engaged in fishing industry .
At present , the Indian government is making active relief efforts to restore local fishermen 's livelihood and local fishing industry as soon as possible .

( Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan ) Hong Kong Economy to Grow about 6 % in 2005 , Research Institute Projects
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , January 11 ( Reporter Su Xiao ) The Center for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) Studies at the University of Hong Kong said on the 11th that with the global economic environment still favorable , Hong Kong 's economy is expected to grow about 6 % this year , and 4.4 % on an annual basis in the first quarter .
Yue-chim Wong , director of the Center for APEC Studies at the University of Hong Kong , said at the " Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast " release that although interest rates this year are expected to rise and economic growth of Hong Kong 's major trading partners will slow down , with the US and Chinese economies expected to grow 3.6 % and 8.5 % respectively , the global economic environment in 2005 is still positive .
He said the Center projects that Hong Kong 's economy will maintain growth of about 6 % in 2005 , while consumer prices will rise 3 % by the end of the year .
Labor market adjustments will remain slow . The unemployment rate will adjust slightly to about 6.3 % by the end of the year .
Uncertainty triggered by fluctuating global oil prices will remain the major factor clouding Hong Kong 's economy .
Shao Qifa , the Center 's deputy director , said that economic growth momentum will slow in the first quarter this year , with total local output growing by 4.4 % . The growth slowdown reflects Hong Kong 's weakening external demand caused by further slowdown in economic growth among Hong Kong 's major trading partners .

Zhou Yiqing , chairman of the preparatory committee for Hong Kong University 's " Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast , " said that Hong Kong 's strong economic growth in 2004 mainly reflects the stable foundations of the local economy and strong competitiveness in foreign trade markets . Hong Kong benefited from robust global economic growth and rapid growth in the mainland economy last year , while the end of deflation also allowed business owners to enjoy more cash flow .
