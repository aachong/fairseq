Bahraini Princess Marries a U.S. soldier ; Astounding Marriage Dissolves in 5 Years
U.S. television stations had once feted the marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam al-Khalifa and U.S. marine Johnson . However , after just five years , this star-crossed marriage has already come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas .
Meriam is a member of the royal family of the Gulf country of Bahrain . Johnson risked his military career over this forbidden love affair . Their fairy-tale marriage was once the theme of a television movie .
Nonetheless , according to the Las Vegas Review Journal , only five years later , the couple went to court when Meriam filed for divorce in Las Vegas , where getting married is quick but getting divorced is quicker .
The two met in 1999 , when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain .
After he met this teenage princess , the pair fell in love and his life thus changed tremendously .
Since the royal family forbade the union of these two young lovers , Johnson smuggled Meriam out of her country and into the United States by disguising her in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , and forging her military identification papers .
After fighting a difficult immigration battle with the U.S. authorities , the couple was finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip , famous for its opulence . At that time , Johnson was 23 , and the bride was only 19 .
However , Johnson stated that because of the many temptations in Las Vegas , so-called " Sin City , " the continuous tensions between him and Meriam 's rich and powerful family , and the rumor of plots to assassinate him , this marriage , which had endured all kinds of hardships , finally dissolved .
Johnson said that he worked as a parking valet for hotel and casino guests , while Meriam gradually got sucked into the nightlife of the casino city . She frequented nightclubs late at night and ignored her husband .
Meriam left her husband a year ago .
Johnson said , " She 's gone off the deep end . "
This Week 's Eurozone Indicators Shows A Continually Weak European Economy
Economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by Eurozone this week would provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while British data is expected to show a growth in industrial activities .
They said that economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to show great volatility every month , but the long-term trend will demonstrate a slow down in economic growth .
This week 's key figures will be in Germany . The closely watched economic expectations index , which is expected to be released on the 7th by the ZEW Economic Institute , will provide the first evidence of December 's economic confidence in Europe .
The ZEW index plummeted to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month .
In a recent survey , economists indicated that the substantial appreciation of the Euro will continue to affect economic confidence , thus there is no reason to anticipate a rebound in the economic expectations index .
A BNP economist said , " Given that the main factors negatively affecting economic confidence - the appreciation of the Euro , uncertainty over global growth , and the weak labor market and increasing unemployment in Germany - have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period , a strong rebound is unlikely . "
According to a survey conducted by AFX News , the AFP financial news subsidiary , economists believed that this index would drop again to 11 in December from 13.9 in the prior month .
Nevertheless , Teather of UBS Investment Bank said that the ZEW economic expectations index of Germany might even fall to zero in December .
Teather said , " According to our view , expectations of future German economic activity , as reflected in the ZEW survey of analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall . "
Ukrainian Crisis Creates East-West Tensions ; Expected to Be on OSCE Meeting Agenda
Russia has repeatedly accused the West of interfering in Eastern European affairs . The issue has become the focus of attention due to the political crisis in Ukraine . It will also be at the top of the agenda of tomorrow 's annual ministers meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .
The creeping Western influence into corners of Europe previously considered by Russia as its backyard , such as the Baltic States , Georgia , and Central Asia , has long disgruntled Russia . Thus , recent incidents in Ukraine will probably dominate the two-day OSCE meeting to be held in Sofia , the capital city of Bulgaria .
The Supreme Court of Ukraine has made the dramatic decision to order a rerun of the recent runoff of the presidential election . Prior to that , the European Union has already appealed to the OSCE member states to prepare their observers to " take action as quickly and efficiently as possible . "
Europeans revealed that the number of observers dispatched by OSCE to the election rerun in Ukraine scheduled to be held on December 26 would increase from the original 600 to 1,000 .
U.S. Secretary of State Powell will attend this OSCE annual meeting , which may be his last foreign visit before leaving office .
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov , French Foreign Minister Barnier , British Foreign Secretary Straw , and German Foreign Minister Fischer will also attend the meeting .
Members of OSCE include 55 nations in North America , Europe , and Asia . The organization will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year .
The organization was established at the Helsinki Conference that very year and contributed to the ending of the Cold War .
Congress ' Vote on Intelligence Overhaul Bill This Week a Crucial Test for Bush
The U.S. Congress will push hard to pass the Intelligence Overhaul Bill this week . The bill is an ambitious second-term agenda for Republican President Bush . His support among the Republican congressmen will face its first major test after his reelection .
Kean , the former Republican New Jersey Governor responsible for the investigation of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11 , 2001 , said during an interview with the press that the issue of the Intelligence Overhaul Bill is that Congress has to approve it . This matter alone presents unfavorable signs for future cooperation between the two parties and the president 's domestic policies .
Kean said , " Congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and Congress can 't get these big issues taken care of , and then we 're all in trouble . "
He told the New York Daily News , " It 'll be a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the Republican and Democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80 percent of the American people in the polls . "
Several congressmen stated yesterday that if this groundbreaking reform bill failed , it would delay the overhaul of the U.S. antiquated intelligence network for months , years , or even kill its existence entirely .
Harman , ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , stated on CNN , " If the bill isn 't passed this week , it dies . "
The Congress will try to pass the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 again on the 6th and the 7th . It will then adjourn until next year .
If it is vetoed , the bill will be annulled and the Congress will rewrite a new bill in the 2005 session .
Ukrainian Opposition Party Firmly Rejects Constitutional-Reform Bill That Drastically Curbs Presidential Power
The Pro-Western Opposition Party in Ukraine today insisted that it would not accept the constitutional amendments advanced by outgoing President Kuchma before the rerun of the presidential election .
This constitutional reform will strip most of the power currently held by the President .
After the Supreme Court annulled the results of the rigged runoff election held on November 21 , the Central Election Commission ordered a rerun on December 26 . Opposition leader Yushchenko is again at loggerheads with Kuchma .
Tymoshenko , Yushchenko 's ally , stated , " If the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the President would be transferred to the Parliament . This would be unacceptable . "
She told reporters , " We hope that the President could appoint the Chief of the Intelligence Bureau and the Prosecutor-General so we can fight corruption and eliminate groups that control Ukrainian politics and business circles . "
Due to his worry that the Opposition Party may win in the presidential election , Kuchma , who has close ties with Russia , advanced the constitutional reform ahead of the reelection .
Yesterday , Opposition Party members in the Parliament refused to vote on the constitutional-reform bill put forward by the government . As a result , the Parliament will recess for 10 days .
According to the constitutional amendment bill , the authority to appoint all top officials except the Prime Minister , the Defense Minister , and the Foreign Minister will be transferred from the hand of the President to the Parliament , in which pro-government forces currently have a close majority .
According to the constitutional amendment bill , the appointment of the Prime Minister , Defense Minister , and Foreign Minster by the President have to be approved by the Parliament , while the Parliament can also name their own candidates .
Third Week of Ukrainian Political Crisis ; Opposition Party Calls for A Continuous Resistance
The chaos sparked off by the presidential election in Ukraine has entered its third week . Opposition leader Yushchenko called on his supporters to continue their street protests and their blockade of the presidential palace and government buildings , until outgoing President Kushma fires Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet , and to take actions to ensure justice in the upcoming rerun of the presidential runoff election .
Tens of thousands of Yushchenko 's supporters have gathered in the capital city of Kiev for two weeks . They surround government buildings and camp out on major roads designed by Russian specialists for viewing military marches . Their demonstration of the power of the masses has forced the Supreme Court to declare the presidential election on November 21 invalid . The Central Election Commission ordered a new election on December 26 and the Parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych . However , Kushma still has not signed the administrative order to replace the successor , whom he fostered personally .
Yushchenko told the supporters gathered at the Independence Square tonight that Kushma should replace his government and reshuffle the Central Election Commission , and that both the Parliament and Kushma should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent any electoral fraud .
In his speech that unveiled the runoff on December 26 , he stated , " Before these decisions are implemented , we should not discuss lifting the blockade of government buildings and the presidential palace .
During these 2 weeks , this square has demonstrated its ardent love for Ukraine , and the civil awareness of tens of millions of Ukrainians who can defend their choices . "
He stated , " We are going through a struggle between the good and evil powers . The whole world is cheering for our victory and the entire world is proud of Ukraine . "
While the Opposition Party exerts more pressure on the governing authorities backed by Moscow , and Yushchenko and Kushma are at a deadlock once again on constitutional reform , Polish President Kwasniewski , Lithuanian President Adamkus , and Russian envoy Gryzlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev on the 6th for another effort at mediation .
Egypt Announces Breakthrough in Middle East Peace Predicament
Egypt stated that a new structure is anticipated for the Middle East peace agreement .
It also said that it might dispatch an Ambassador to Israel again in the near future to resume full diplomatic relations , which have been severed for four years .
The state-run Middle East News Agency in Egypt cited " senior " Egyptian figures as saying that all parties seeking a peace plan are gradually coming to a consensus regarding the overall reconciliation .
The Middle East News Agency stated , " Egypt , Israel , Palestine , and important international entities such as the United States and the European Union have reached an important understanding and have agreed in principle to resolve the Israel-Palestine clashes completely . "
Since the death of Palestinian strongman Arafat last month , the international community resumes the advancement of the Middle East peace policy , hoping to end prolonged bloodshed between Israel and Palestine as soon as possible .
The Middle East News Agency reported that officials expect " the preparation work will continue until July and political action will be taken afterwards . "
The Middle East News Agency indicated that afterwards , parties that are concerned about the Middle East peace progress , including Israel , Palestine , Egypt , the United States , Russia , and a few European countries , would hold a meeting in Washington .
It is expected that the agenda for the meeting will include a " ceasefire on both sides , " and Palestinian authorities will " stop anti-Israeli attacks and strengthen its control on the Gaza Strip and West Bank . "
In regards to this , the Middle East News Agency reported that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon promised , " as long as Palestinian authorities honor the armistice agreement and have control over their territories , Israel will stop its military action on the Palestinians . "
Over 1 Billion Children Worldwide Suffer from War , Poverty , and HIV / AIDS
An annual report published by UNICEF today shows that over 1 billion children , half of the world 's children , suffer from poverty , war , and HIV / AIDS .
UNICEF pointed out that the rights of children to have a healthy and protected upbringing stated clearly in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child are frequently denied , partly because of governments ' failure to implement human rights and economic reforms .
During the launch of the annual report in London , UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out , " When half the world 's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy , when schools have become targets and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS , we 've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood . "
Bellamy added , " Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually will hurt childhood . "
Data compiled jointly by researchers at UNICEF , the London School of Economics , and Bristol University reveals a gruesome picture of children in dangerous situations in most parts of the world .
Researchers discovered that about 640 million children worldwide lack proper shelter , 400 million children do not have access to safe drinking water , 270 million children do not have health care services , and 140 million children ( mostly girls ) have never attended school .
Researchers pointed out that a more serious fact is that at least 700 million children suffer from all forms of " extreme deprivation , " including lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities .
The 10th annual report released by UNICEF today indicates that wars and HIV / AIDS have destroyed all the networks that are usually able to protect children . Moreover , children are often the direct victims of wars and HIV / AIDS .
EU Resists Chinese Pressure to Lift Arms Embargo
The European Union today rejected pressure from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao for a quick end of the arms embargo on China . However , it also indicated that it would strive toward lifting this 15-year-old embargo .
The Netherlands , the EU rotating presidency , made the above statement after the Sino-EU Summit .
The Netherlands stated that how EU will end this embargo should not be wildly speculated .
The EU imposed the arms embargo on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
Even though the arms embargo issue had cast a shadow over the Sino-EU Summit , the two sides still signed a number of trade and other agreements .
Both China and the EU claimed that these agreements have strengthened their " strategic partnership . "
In a joint declaration released after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , the EU stated , " The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo . "
The declaration stated that the Chinese delegate " welcomed the positive sign and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU . "
Wen Jiabao did not hide his displeasure at the press conference after the summit . He said that this embargo " does not reflect the partnership between China and the EU . "
Wen Jiabao stated , " The embargo is a product of the Cold War . It neither reflects the current situation nor the partnership between China and the EU . "
Some EU nations , spearheaded by France , encouraged the lifting of this arms embargo , stating that it is out-dated .
Without the amendment and strengthening of EU 's related laws , critics worry that the lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates for arms sales and boost China 's military strength .
Balkenende , Prime Minister of the Netherlands , claimed , " I explained that within the EU there is a willingness to lift the embargo , but I also explained that this is related to adjusting the code of conduct on arms exports . "
Preliminary Findings : Possible Link of Folic Acid to Breast Cancer , But Results Inconclusive
A recent health study suggests that a B vitamin ( folic acid ) commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects may increase the chance of breast cancer .
Nonetheless , researchers stated that their results might be a chance finding , because other research suggests that folic acid will in fact lower the risk of breast cancer . Thus , they advised pregnant women to continue taking this supplement .
Folic acid naturally exists in dark green vegetables and it is already known in medical circles that this is an important aid in the development of the fetus .
Researchers from the University of Bristol and the University of Aberdeen in Britain followed 3,000 women who had taken 5 mg or 0.2 mg dose of folic acid or a placebo , mostly during their second and third trimesters of pregnancies in the 1960s .
This research , published in the British Medical Journal , showed that by September 2002 , those who had taken 5 mg doses of folic acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as those who took only the placebo .
Ness , one of the researchers , stressed that these results present " preliminary findings that are intended to point the way toward further research . "
He stated , " It is entirely possible that this is a chance finding -- so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is one , before we reach any conclusions . "
Ness said that women planning to become pregnant should continue to take folic acid supplements .
He claimed that the current recommended dosage and " the experimental dosage are considerably different . "
According to the UK 's health standards , women planning to become pregnant and those who are in their first trimester of pregnancies should have 0.4 mg of folic acid everyday , which is more than 10 times lower than the dosage taken by the women in the above study .
Two Candidates Face Ukrainian Presidential Rerun in Completely Different Mood
The two rivals who will face off for the Ukrainian presidential rerun on the 26th of this month are geared up for the match .
Western-leaning Opposition leader Yushchenko is confident of winning while pro-Russian current Prime Minister Yanukovich declared that he is no longer running for the " shameful " ruling party .
Meanwhile , Russian President Putin changed his attitude towards Ukraine 's entering into the European Union and expressed his pleasure to see it happen .
When asked about the percentage of votes he expected to get in the rerun , Yushchenko told the reporters who filled the venue of the press conference , " Conservatively speaking , I should have about 60 percent of the votes . "
On the other hand , the anxious-looking Yanukovich , who ducked several of the reporters ' questions , only said , " We will win as per God 's will " at the end .
Yanukovich , the original anointed successor of current President Kuchma , has changed his course and cast himself as the candidate who is fighting against the Opposition Party and the ruling party .
He was close to mentioning names when he said , " I used to trust those cowards and traitors who worked in the government , but now I am very disappointed . This government is very shameful . "
Kuchma made a deal with the Opposition Party to transfer part of the presidential power to the Parliament through a legislative amendment in order to end the Opposition Party 's large-scale protest and political turmoil that has lasted for two weeks since the presidential runoff on November 21 .
The Supreme Court also declared the original victory of Yanukovich invalid because of the rigged election process and ordered a rerun to be held .
Powell 's Visit to Hague a Final Push for Europe-US Harmony Before Leaving Office
U.S. Secretary of State Powell held a meeting with EU senior officials today for a last attempt at bringing cohesion between the United States and the EU before his leaving office .
Powell 's European visit aims at repairing the diplomatic relations harmed by the Iraq War . The Hague is the last stop of his visit .
This might be Powell 's last official overseas visit . The EU promised him that they will work towards easing strained ties ahead of U.S. President Bush 's European visit next February .
Nonetheless , differences between the two sides still exist .
Dutch Foreign Minister Bot , whose country currently holds the EU rotating presidency , said , " We have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground in the second term of President Bush . "
EU External Relations Commissioner Ms. Waldner stated that she believed Europe and the United States had already made some progress in " putting the difficult moments of the Iraq crisis behind us . " However , she also realized that now is the " key moment in the EU-US relationship . "
Bush will meet with EU and NATO leaders in Brussels on February 22 , 2005 .
Powell stated that Bush 's visit aims at mending the fissures caused by the Iraqi factors .
Powell has visited Sofia and Brussels during this visit but has produced limited results in improving the relationships .
Especially in Brussels , Powell criticized the six anti-war NATO members of hurting the " credibility and cohesion of the alliance " by not participating in the training exercises in Iraq .
Nevertheless , Powell insisted that his meeting has shown the commitment of the United States in reestablishing full diplomatic relationships .
Elected Romanian President Basescu Faces Challenges in Forming Government
Romanian Opposition candidate Basescu won the close presidential election today . However , the mayor of Bucharest , who holds a center-right position , will probably face huge challenges in forming a new government because of the multi-partied and fragmented Parliament .
Final official results announced by the Romanian Central Election Committee today showed that The Justice and Truth Alliance candidate Basescu won 51.23 percent of the votes while his rival , Prime Minister Nastase , had 48.77 percent .
Nastase conceded defeat and congratulated Basescu .
The outgoing president Iliescu had also congratulated Basescu .
Nastase indicated that his Social Democratic Party will assist Basescu in gaining Romania 's entry into the European Union .
The Social Democratic Party won the parliamentary election held on the 28th of last month .
Basescu announced in a press conference , " Today my priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for Romania to join the European Union . " Romania will have to continue to live up to the requirements of gaining entry into the European Union .
He stressed that Romanians should understand the price they will have to pay for this integration . The nation should unite to ensure that there will be no questioning voices about this integration .
Romania has completed the negotiations on joining the European Union and is expected to become a member in January 2007 .
Basescu also listed fighting poverty , eliminating corruption , and ensuring judicial independence as priorities of his governing policies .
Tumult over Past Work Unsettled : Oliver Stone Seeks Peace with Turkey
Movie director Oliver Stone is trying to use the opportunity of promoting his new movie " Alexander " in Istanbul to make peace with Turkey .
His screenplay for the classic " Midnight Express " has been criticized as tarnishing the image of Turkey .
He told AFP in an interview here , " I never intended the screenplay to be against Turkey . It was against injustice everywhere . "
Turks have condemned Stone since the first screening of this award-winning movie in 1978 .
This movie was adapted from the memoirs of Billy Hayes .
Hayes , an American youth who was caught at the Istanbul airport for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country , was sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish prison following a protracted legal battle .
Turkish critics accused Stone of taking liberties with rewriting Hayes ' original work into a racist screenplay . All the Turkish characters in the movie are depicted as villains without exception .
The movie is also full of horrific prison scenes of rape and torture .
Stone admitted , " Perhaps some of the zealousness , some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much , too hard . "
However , he added , " It was true that Billy Hayes did get sodomized in the Turkish prison . He was convicted to a 30-year prison term for an offense not worth mentioning , and he was also treated brutally in prison . So this is all based on the facts . "
Stone said , " The bigger picture is that Turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not properly working . America has similar problems . "
Japanese Economic Growth May Slow Down Next Year
The Japanese economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a widening gap between the rich and the poor may destroy the harmonic atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of the year .
With huge corporate profits and strong consumer spending , Japan has regained its confidence after 10 years of stagnation , but analysts rest their hopes for sustaining the economic growth on China despite the rising political tensions between the two countries .
Evidence has gradually shown that the Japanese economy may suffer a temporary setback in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to fall while manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid overstock .
According to the newly adopted statistical methodology , the Japanese economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter while it grew by just 0.1 percent in the July-September quarter , narrowly escaping a technical recession .
At present , economists are still greatly divided over the robustness of the Japanese economy .
BNP Paribas researchers anticipated a 2.3 percent growth in real terms in the current fiscal year that ends in March of next year and the next fiscal year .
They called 2005 the " Year of Recovery " based on the reasons that the US economy has remained stable on the recovery track and Japanese consumer spending is picking up the slack for slower exports .
A more pessimistic note is that UFJ Institute economists predicted a mere 1.8 percent economic growth in this fiscal year and a lower 0.6 percent in the following year .
They pointed out the " lurking risk , " meaning corporate profits have not led to higher personal gains .
French Foreign Minister : Middle East Peace Progress To Test France-US Relations
After meeting with US Secretary of State Powell , French Foreign Minister Barnier stated that the resumption of the Middle East peace talks will be a " test " for their Trans-Atlantic ties .
France had called for a quick convening of an international meeting to move forward the Israel-Palestine peace process after the death of Palestinian leader Arafat but there was no sign that an agreement had been reached after the meeting of Barnier and Powell .
Barnier flew from Paris to Washington for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his designated successor Rice , the National Security Advisor , then headed toward Brussels for a European Union summit .
Both Paris and Washington agreed to repair the strained relations brought about by the US invasion of Iraq last year but differences are still obvious in resolving the Middle East impasse .
After a short meeting with Powell at the State Department , Barnier stated , " We want to improve the future relations between the French and Americans and Europeans and Americans . "
He said , " I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis . "
Earlier this week , Barnier called for the convening of an early international Middle East conference in order to take advantage of what he called the " window of opportunity " presented after Arafat 's death last month .
However , Powell remained non-committal .
He said that the two discussed the British plan of a meeting with Palestinian participants but had not mentioned whether a broader international meeting would be convened .
US officials have made known that their most important task is to promote peace in Israel and Palestine , and to ensure the success of the Palestinian election held next month .
This election will produce a leader who can control the Islamic militants and resume the Israel-Palestine talks .
Foreign Minister Machimura Proposes FTA Talks with South Korea in January
Japanese Foreign Minister Machimura Nobutaka proposed today to hold talks on signing a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) between Japan and South Korea as early as next January .
Jiji Press reported that during his meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon in the southern city of Ibusuki of Kagoshima Prefecture , Machimura indicated that since Tokyo and Seoul both hoped to sign a FTA agreement by the end of 2005 , the two parties should resume talks as soon as possible .
Before Machimura 's talks with Ban Ki-Moon , Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun held a summit on the 17th in which Roh Moo-Hyun urged Tokyo authorities to be cautious in imposing economic sanctions on North Korea .
North Korea had kidnapped several Japanese nationals during the Cold War and Prime Minister Koizumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish North Korea .
The families of the kidnapped victims were furious after Japanese researchers concluded that the remains that Pyongyang provided to prove the death of two hostages did not belong to the victims .
Apart from the kidnapping issue , Koizumi and Roh Moo-Hyun both agreed that the six-nation talks that aim at checking North Korean nuclear weapons expansion should recommence as soon as possible .
Since the standoff sparked by North Korea 's secret nuclear weapons program in October 2002 , no concrete results have been achieved in the first three rounds of the six-nation talks .
North Korea later boycotted the fourth round of the six-nation talks scheduled to be held this September .
The six nations that take part in the talks are South Korea , North Korea , the United States , China , Japan , and Russia , respectively .
Thai Premier Thaksin Still Expects to Win February Election
Thai Premier Thaksin is confident of winning his second four-year term when entering 2005 . However , his reputation was tarnished for not being able to suppress the bloody uprising of the separatist insurgents .
A Thai national election is scheduled to be held on February 6 , 2005 . Thaksin and his political rivals are actively preparing for the election . Most analysts expected him to win despite the serious violent clashes and the bird flu in the South .
Twelve people in Thailand have died from bird flu this year . Bird flu swept through most of the Asian regions but was particularly serious in Thailand . The Thai government once admitted that it had " erred " in handling the epidemic .
However , this health problem is unlikely to depose Thaksin 's reelection . On the other hand , many people only asked how big a landslide his victory will be and what significance his victory will have on the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .
Kraisak , Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , told AFP , " The phenomenon is that no matter how one looks at Thaksin , he has managed to capture a vast support from the public for the time being . "
He said , " But things will start to disintegrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and associates ) , the social injustices and the violence . "
Social injustices and violence are the causes of riots in the deep south of Thailand where Islam is the majority , and sporadic revolts have been happening since January .
Since January , Muslim extremists have targeted Buddhists , government officials , and security troops in their shootouts . They also carried out bombings and beheadings . Up until now , more than 560 people have died and 100 have been reported missing .
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Claims Arafat Poisoned a Year Ago
Abdel Rahman , Cabinet Secretary of late Palestinian leader Arafat , revealed that Arafat was poisoned when receiving a delegation of supporters at the Ramallah compound a year ago .
Abdel Rahman told the Al-Hayat newspaper , " Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago . It was on September 25 , 2003 .
The President shook hands with each of the 30-some supporters . Afterwards , the President began vomiting .
It was from that moment that the president 's health started slowly deteriorating . "
Arafat passed away in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11 .
Some senior Palestinian officials believed that Arafat was poisoned .
Nonetheless , French doctors stated that such allegations did not have any medical grounds .
Two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by Abdel Rahman , the cabinet of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon decided to unseat Arafat but did not specify by what means .
Israel 's threat had set off waves of support for Arafat , who thus received several delegations of supporters .
Abdel Rahman recalled , " Arafat shook hands with people who had come to express their support for Arafat in his confinement imposed by Israel . "
On September 25 of last year , Arafat received two groups ; one was a global peace-advocating cyclist group while the other was a political activist group .
Abdel Rahman indicated , " The last time he became ill , on October 12 , 2004 , he had the same symptoms : vomiting , loss of appetite , and all the symptoms that were similar to contracting a flu . "
Bush Admits Iraqi Troops Need More Training - Defends Rumsfeld
US President Bush conceded today that Iraqi troops are not ready to take over for US troops . He also warned that the election scheduled on January 30 , 2005 will not be the end of the major insurgency in Iraq .
In a one-hour press conference , Bush also expressed his support for Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld , insisting the Pentagon chief " is doing a really fine job . "
Bush said that despite occasional major disagreements , he vowed to continue his cooperation with Russian President Putin , claiming that this is the moment to work towards ending the clashes in the Middle East .
He believed the best way to handle issues regarding the surviving members of the " Axis of Evil " - Iran and North Korea , is through multilateral diplomacy .
Car bombs exploded one after another in the two Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Kabala yesterday , killing 66 people and injuring over 200 . Bush openly admitted that the Iraqis have paid the price of the riots but insisted that it will not derail the January election .
Bush cautioned Americans that the Iraqi election " is only the beginning of a political process " and warned , " I certainly don 't expect the process to be trouble-free . "
Bush also admitted that the results of the Iraqi security troops training are mixed .
He said , " There have been some cases where , when the heat got on , they left the battlefield . "
He said that this kind of Iraqi troops will never secure their country . That it is unacceptable .
Nonetheless , he believed that the prolonged training of the Iraqi troops by the US army would yield results .
White House : Iraqi Insurgents ' Attempts to Derail Election Doomed to Fail
Twenty-two U.S. and Iraqi soldiers were killed and over 60 were injured in an insurgent attack targeted at a restaurant on a U.S. military base in the major city of Mosul in Northern Iraq at noon today . White House spokesperson McClellan said that with the Iraqi election approaching , terrorist attacks carried out by Iraqi insurgents will intensify . Nonetheless , these " enemies of freedom " will be eliminated .
Reports from Iraq stated that the huge explosion that caused serious casualties happened at noon in the U.S. military base restaurant while the soldiers were having lunch .
The Iraqi interim government is expected to hold its first election following the downfall of Hussein 's regime , on January 30 .
The United States has deployed 20,000 more troops to ensure safety during the Iraqi election .
The number of U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq will reach 150,000 during the Iraqi election .
McClellan said that , as the election draws closer , Saddam 's loyalists , who want to go back to the past , will launch more terrorist attacks in order to derail the transitional government , but that " They will be defeated . They are being defeated . "
A recent poll showed that 56 percent of Americans believed that the Iraq War is " not worth fighting . " Fifty-seven percent disagreed with President Bush 's handling of the Iraqi situation , while 52 percent thought that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld should resign . McClellan stated that President Bush would not dance around the opinion poll .
" The opinion poll is a one-time figure while we continue our work according to progress in Iraq . "
Mourners Join Funeral Procession of Philippine 's Political Figure , Poe
Tens of thousands of fans attended the funeral today of Philippine 's top movie star , Poe , which was held under tight security out of fear of riots .
The 65-year-old Poe once ran for the presidency but was defeated .
Poe 's coffin , accompanied by a group of mourners , was pulled through the streets of Manila in a carriage drawn by two white horses .
A large number of riot police were stationed around Malacanang Palace to prevent Poe 's supporters from rioting .
These people accused President Arroyo of cheating in the presidential election on May 10 .
The army was also on heightened alert amid intelligence reports of a possible coup to overthrow Arroyo and replace her with Poe 's widow , Rocess .
The funeral , however , ended peacefully . Fans chanted Poe 's initials - FPJ - and waved the posters he once used for his election .
Poe died of a stroke on December 14 .
Crying women and children showered the coffin with flowers when the hearse wound its way to the cemetery .
Since Justice Secretary Gonzales warned that some people might use the funeral to stir up trouble , Malacanang Palace , which was close to the route of the procession , was barricaded with huge shipping containers .
Gonzales said that " a credible intelligence report " showed that some people had conspired to use the funeral march and burial to instigate the masses to go against the government .
However , armed forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Pascual claimed that the coup conspiracy was obviously dissolved after troops were deployed to guard key areas .
Arroyo later stepped out of Malacanang Palace to greet the military police that guarded the area .
Armitage Warns Syria to Cooperate with U.S. on Iraqi , Lebanese Issues
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage issued warnings to Syria today that future relations between Damascus and Washington will depend on Syria 's willingness to cooperate with the United States on issues with Iraq and Lebanon .
Armitage exerted more pressure on Syria during an interview with Arab reporters .
The State Department released the interview content earlier .
When asked whether tensions between the United States and Syria are expected to continue , Armitage replied , " I hope that our relations with Syria do not worsen further but it 's entirely in the hands of ( Syrian president ) Assad . "
The State Department 's No. 2 figure stated that Damascus should carry out Resolution 1559 passed by the UN Security Council this September and end all interference in the neighboring country of Lebanon .
Armitage claimed that through its behavior , Syria " is not working against the United States , but to set itself against the entire international community . "
When reporters further asked if the United States would bring up Syria 's refusal to cooperate next January when the UN Security Council discusses renewing the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon , Armitage 's reply was " It is very possible . "
When touching on Iraqi issues , Armitage conceded that Damascus has adopted some measures that meet U.S. demands , such as strengthening its joint border patrols with Iraq and blocking the sources of insurgent funds .
Nonetheless , he also pointed out that Syria has " to do much more . "
AIT , TERCO Sign Lease on New Building Site in Neihu
The American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S. ( TECRO ) signed a lease on a new AIT building site in Neihu . AIT Director Douglas Paal stated that the new building is currently being designed . He hoped that construction would be finished as soon as possible so that they could operate in a safe and modern environment .
Douglas Paal and TECRO Director General John Chen signed a 99-year lease of the land that will be the site of the new AIT building at Taipei Hyatt Hotel at noon .
Witnesses at the signing ceremony included AIT Deputy Director Keegan and TERCO Deputy Director General Jacqueline Liu . Foreign Minister Mark Chen was also present .
AIT was established according to the Taiwan Relations Act to handle unofficial relations between the United States and Taiwan . It has offices in both Taipei and Kaohsiung .
Douglas Paal mentioned in his speech that AIT has been working with TERCO and Taipei City Government to find a piece of land to construct a new AIT building for more than 10 years .
He said that the existing Hsin Yi Road office looks old and shabby and is literally running out of space .
For AIT , moving to a new office building will be a challenge . AIT can centralize its offices , which are scattered throughout Taipei , and operate in a safe and modern environment .
He stated that the new building is currently being designed . He hoped that the building will add luster to Taiwan and will be something that Taipei residences will take pride in .
Once the design is completed , they will invite bids for the construction contract . The construction will begin as soon as the contract is awarded . It is hoped that the groundbreaking will take place in a few years .
AIT spokesperson Dana Smith said that the office building , including rent and design , is expected to cost approximately US $ 160 million . Many factors will determine whether it can be finished by 2008 , but she hoped that it would be as soon as possible .
Thousands of Pilgrims Flock to Bethlehem for Midnight Mass
Thousands of pilgrims are gathering in Bethlehem in the West Bank waiting to attend Midnight Mass .
Meanwhile , the mainstream Palestinian Liberation Organization , Fatah , is likely to win over Hamas in yesterday 's Palestinian regional elections .
As for violent clashes , gunfire broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen , resulting in the deaths of three Palestinian youths .
Israeli settlers blocked a major road in protest of mortar attacks on the settlement regions .
Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Abbas was also permitted to go to the West Bank town of Bethlehem ; this is the first time Israeli authorities have allowed top-ranking Palestinian leaders to attend Christmas celebrations in four years .
The late Palestinian leader Arafat had been a regular guest at the Midnight Mass in Bethlehem after returning to the Palestinian region in 1994 . However , since the beginning of December 2001 , Arafat had been confined to his Ramallah headquarters by Israeli troops .
The Latin Patriarch of Bethlehem , Sabbah , set off from Jerusalem shortly after noon to begin his traditional procession to Manger Square in Bethlehem , where thousands of Christians and Muslim onlookers were gathering .
Sabbah is scheduled to speak to thousands of pilgrims during Midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity .
Pilgrims holding Santa balloons packed Manger Square before noon and kept going in and out of the Church of the Nativity . A Christmas tree outside the church was decorated with all kinds of lights and ornaments .
Israeli authorities had eased travel restrictions to make it easier for Christians from the Gaza Strip , the West Bank , and Israel to attend the Midnight Mass in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve .
Putin Declares Purchase of Yuko 's Major Asset Is To Protect State Interests
Russian President Putin stated today that the state 's purchase of Russian oil giant Yuko 's major asset was to protect the interests of the state . It is also the first re-nationalization action taken in the post-Soviet era .
When discussing the state-run petroleum company Rosneft 's purchase of Yuko 's subsidiary company , Yuganskneftegaz , at the end-of-the-year press conference in the Kremlin , Putin stated , " Today the state , using absolutely legal market mechanisms , is protecting its interests .
I consider this absolutely normal . "
Rosneft became the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after acquiring Baikal Finance Group , the company that won the bid for Yuganskneftegaz at an earlier secret auction .
Rosneft issued an unexpected announcement a little before midnight last night - that it has acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown Baikal Finance Group .
This acquisition gives the Kremlin solid control over the energy industry , which is vital to Russia .
In the past 18 months , Russia has repeatedly attacked Yuko and its billionaire founder , Khodorkorsky , who is presently in prison .
Rosneft is merging with state-run Gazprom . With the addition of Yuganskneftegaz , the three together will control one fifth of the total oil production in Russia and all its natural gas production , thus becoming the world 's largest energy group .
Putin defends the state-purchase actions by criticizing murky privatizations in the 1990s .
The privatization policy at that time had allowed Russia 's most valuable economic asset to fall into the hands of slick businessmen like Khodorkorsky .
Baikal Finance Group won control of Yuganskneftegaz earlier with a bid of U.S. $ 9.35 billion .
Yushchenko Declares Victory in Ukraine Presidential Election
With the preliminary election results showing Opposition Party leader Yushchenko leading his rival , current Prime Minister Yanukovich , in the rerun of the presidential election , and Yushchenko 's declaring victory himself , Yushchenko 's supporters again gathered at Kiev 's central Independent Square for a victory celebration .
50-year-old Yushchenko told the crowd at the square , " This is a unique , clear political victory . "
He said , " This is an elegant victory for the people , who have proven their power . Ukrainians have bravely stood up and resisted probably the most perverse regime in Eastern Europe . This is a victory for the Ukrainian nation , the Ukrainian people . "
He stated , " We have been independent for 14 years but we were not free . "
Yushchenko added , " Today , Ukraine entered a new political era .
The era of ( outgoing President ) Kuchma , ( Kuchma 's predecessor ) Kravchuk , and ( current Prime Minister ) Yanukovich is a thing of the past . "
According to the Ukrainian Central Election Committee , citing the counted votes at more than half of the polling precincts , Opposition leader Yushchenko is temporarily leading his rival , present Prime Minister Yanukovich , by 16 percent in this historical presidential runoff election .
The Ukrainian Central Election Committee stated that pro-Western Yushchenko has 56.33 percent of the votes , compared to 39.86 percent for pro-Russian Yanukovich .
The results were based on the votes counted at 50.96 percent of the polling precincts across Ukraine .
There were over 33,000 polling precincts in Ukraine .
The exit poll released earlier also showed that Yushchenko led Yanukovich by 15 to 20 percent .
Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs And Communications Pilots Telecommuting to Reduce Stress of Office Life
The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications launched an advanced Internet program today , in the hopes that by 2010 , 20 percent of the Japanese workforce can " telecommute " from home through this program in order to reduce stress from office life and disruptive family problems .
An official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that currently , approximately 4 million Japanese , representing 6 percent of the total workforce of 63.2 million people , utilize technology to work outside the office .
Starting in January , six Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications employees will be working outside the office , either from home , from universities , or from libraries through high-speed Internet service at least once a week .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will then expand the scope of this advanced program based on feedback , until 20 percent of its 2500 employees can work from home by 2006 .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official said that this program , which allows employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing , will hopefully " improve the efficiency of work places . "
He said that telecommuting would allow employees to spend more time with their families , so that breadwinners can also help out with more chores .
He stated that this program could also reduce traffic congestion , including car exhaust and the overcrowding of trains during rush hour .
He claimed that the goal of this program is , " through the encouragement of sharing telecommuting technologies with the private sector , " to increase the ratio of Japanese telecommuters to 10 percent by 2005 and then to 20 percent by 2010 .
Pentagon Launches Unprecedented Relief Efforts for Asian Tsunami Victims
The Pentagon stated today that it has launched one of its biggest relief efforts to help Asian tsunami victims , including mobilizing two aircraft carrier battle groups , 20 aircraft , including reconnaissance and supply planes , and tens of thousands of personnel .
Lt. Cmdr Hicks , a spokesman for the Pentagon , said that after the December 26th tsunami that killed over 80,000 people , the U.S. military is facing the challenge of operating in several different regions at the same time .
He told AFP , " It is one of the largest humanitarian relief operations by the Pentagon . "
Lt. Gen. Conway , Director of Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff responsible for military actions , stated that they were seeking to assess the scope of this disaster and had sent disaster relief assessment teams to Thailand , Sri Lanka , and Indonesia .
The Pentagon said that it had dispatched 20 aircraft to South Asia , among which were six C-130 transporters that carried drinking water and food , five KC-135 refueling planes , and nine P3 reconnaissance planes .
The Pentagon also mobilized the " Abraham Lincoln " and " Bonhomme Richard " aircraft carriers and their corresponding ships .
Conway stated that the " Lincoln " strike group , with its corresponding 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel , were sent to the Gulf of Siam from Hong Kong and will eventually deploy off the coast of Somalia .
The " Richard , " which carries 25 helicopters , 2,100 Marines , and 1,400 sailors , had left Guam and is expected to arrive at the Bay of Bengal by January 7 .
The Pentagon has decided to mobilize five ships from Guam and two ships that can produce fresh water from the Diego Garcia Base on the Indian Ocean .
Conway stated that the U.S. army 's relief operations would use the Thailand Utapao Base on the Gulf of Siam as its command center .
Argentine Capital Nightclub Fire Killed at Least 169 and Injured 375
City officials of the Argentine Capital of Buenos Aires said today that a huge fire broke out in a downtown nightclub in Buenos Aires , killing at least 169 people and injuring 375 .
When the fire broke out , the nightclub was packed with approximately 2,000 youngsters who were celebrating the end of the school year .
Stein , the City Health Secretary , said that the above casualty toll was not final .
Argentine Interior Minister Fernandez told reporters outside the still burning nightclub , " This is a disaster ! This is a disaster ! " and cautioned that the death toll was speculative .
Stein said that at least 375 people were injured in the burning flames , including 18 police officers .
Stein stated that a fire broke out in this downtown discotheque before midnight on the 30th . Approximately 2,000 youngsters were attending a rock concert at that time .
Buenos Aires Mayor Ibarra claimed that unconfirmed reports stated that the fire started after someone tossed a flare during the concert .
Ibarra told the Todo Noticias television channel today , " This is a terrible night . "
While firefighters were battling the flames , the victims ' bodies were lined up on the street .
A chaotic situation emerged outside the burned discotheque this morning , with hundreds of police and firefighters mingling with terrified youngsters and anxious parents who were frantically looking for their children .
UN : Relief Supplies Won 't Reach Aceh Victims for Weeks
The United Nations said today that the urgently needed aid will take " weeks " to deliver to tsunami victims in isolated regions of Aceh , Indonesia .
U.S. navy helicopters arrived at Aceh 's capital of Banda Aceh today . More and more field hospitals are operating inside the city while large amounts of relief supplies are gradually arriving at the airport .
However , Elmquist , the chief of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia , told reporters that the relief supplies cannot be delivered quickly due to numerous coordination and infrastructure problems .
Elmquist told the reporter over the telephone after returning to Jakarta from Banda Aceh , " It 's going to take weeks before we can get the relief supplies to all the isolated areas . "
He said , " It 's a concern and we are desperately doing what we can to find ways of establishing distribution systems in Banda Aceh . "
The United Nations and other relief organizations have warned that if victims in Indonesian Sumatra regions do not have clean drinking water , food , and medical treatment immediately , they will die in a few days .
When asked if the delay in delivery was literally sentencing the tsunami victims to death , Elmquist replied , " I hope not . I hope that people are finding ways to get food and water , but obviously it 's not a situation we are happy about . "
He said , " It 's a very serious situation and we can only hope that it 's possible to do something quicker . "
Japan Outpledges Nations with 500 Million U.S. Dollars
Japan promised today to provide U.S. $ 500 million to aid countries affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami . While countries are competing to assist victims of the world 's worst disaster , Japan 's pledge has topped the donor 's list of all nations and increased the total international relief and reconstruction fund raised so far to U.S. $ 1.6 billion .
Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro issued a statement saying that as Asia 's largest economy , Japan would consider providing more assistance , including money and technology .
He said , " Japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways : financial resources , knowledge and technology , and human resources . "
He stated , " For the time being , Japan will extend to affected countries and international organizations concerned up to U.S. $ 500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the damage . "
Koizumi added that he would participate in the world leaders meeting held in Jakarta on the 6th to discuss issues on assisting tsunami-hit countries .
After U.S. President Bush was accused of being slow in reacting to this human catastrophe , the U.S. government had raised the relief amount it promised ten-fold to U.S. $ 350 million yesterday .
China , considered to be more and more inclined to challenge Japan 's influence in Asia , also promised to provide U.S. $ 60.5 million assistance , a huge amount for a developing country .
Koizumi claimed , " Japan will make further contributions by utilizing fire department helicopters and personnel .
Japan will also consider , as early as possible , additional contributions by mobilizing Japan Self-Defense Forces aircraft , vessels and personnel . "
Japan had originally pledged U.S. $ 30 million to aid tsunami-hit countries .
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that the U.S. $ 30 million was included in the U.S. $ 500 million that Koizumi mentioned .
WHO : 50 Organizations Will Provide Medical Aid to Aceh Indonesia
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said today that 50 relief organizations have arrived in Aceh to provide medical aid to survivors of the tsunami .
Petersen , the WHO 's Indonesian representative , said that the WHO was trying to coordinate all the organizations and had a meeting with them in the afternoon .
Petersen claimed that the coordination was extremely difficult since many organizations have gone directly to Aceh to provide relief efforts .
In a telephone interview from Jakarta , Petersen said , " We are trying to sort it out , everyone has just come in , however , everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate . "
Petersen stressed that the main concern of the WHO was to prevent the outbreak of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea , which can cause tens of thousands of deaths .
Petersen said , " We are very worried since we have a large number of people displaced who don 't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies .
So we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks . "
Nonetheless , Petersen emphasized that there had not been any sign of such disease yet .
The Indonesian Health Ministry said that the death toll of the tsunami in Sumatra may reach 100,000 people , with most of them in Aceh .
Since most of Aceh 's medical facilities had been destroyed , since last week the Indonesian army and the governments of Singapore and Australia have set up at least eight field hospitals , while the United Nations Children 's Fund has also begun distributing basic medical kits to help 200,000 children .
Powell Predicts Shiites to Win in Iraqi Election
U.S. Secretary of State Powell predicted today that the Shiites will win in the upcoming Iraqi election . However , he believed that since the Iraqi and Iranian Shiites were on bad terms with each other before , it should not be a concern that the Shiites ' victory may increase Iranian influence in Iraq .
More and more evidence has shown that Sunni Muslims will either boycott the January 31 election or will be prevented from participating in the election by the Iraqi authorities for spreading insurgency .
Powell said on NBC 's Meet the Press show , " The new government that comes into place in Baghdad , the transitional national assembly , will be majority Shiite .
That 's the majority of the population . "
Shiite Muslims made up more than 60 percent of the Iraqi population ; most of them reside in southern and central Iraq .
The Sunnis , who constitute 20 percent of the population , live in the central and western provinces .
Former Foreign Minister Pachachi , who is the current leader of the Iraqi Independent Democrats dominated by the Sunnis , called for the postponement of the election today but Powell claimed that the Iraqi election will be held as scheduled .
Powell added that the control of the future Iraqi government by the Shiites does not mean that Iran will have control of Iraq 's political situation .
He said , " My sense right now is that , even though there may be Iranian influence - and Iranians will try to influence the Iraqi political situation , of course - there is a sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between Iranian and Iraqi Shiites . "
International Aid Pours In ; Tsunami Victims Racing Against Time
Overseas rescue troops are airdropping food and building clean water supply systems in tsunami-hit disaster areas in Asia in order to help several million homeless and starving victims .
Figures showed that the death toll has reached almost 150,000 .
Relief supplies continue to pour in from governments while U.S. President Bush appointed his father , Bush Senior , and former president Clinton to be in charge of raising private aid .
The delegation headed by U.S. Secretary of State Powell arrived in Thailand last night to show U.S. concern and assess the relief work progress before the crisis summit in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on the 6th .
Accompanying Powell were Jeb Bush , younger brother of President Bush and Governor of Florida ; and Natsios , the chief of the U.S. Agency for International Development .
Powell will lead the delegation to tour Thailand , Indonesia , and Sri Lanka to inspect the disaster situation before attending the summit on the 6th .
Powell stated that the objective of his tour was to assess the disaster situation " and see what else we might need to do " but he will not make any immediate promise to increase the donations beyond the U.S. $ 350 million already pledged .
After the disaster , talks of giving up the search for thousands of visitors who remain missing , most of them foreign tourists , have surfaced .
However , Thai Prime Minister Thaksin vowed to continue the search in this country .
Thaksin told reporters at Phuket Island , " Foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . We will continue to use our best efforts , and we will not stop searching . "
The largest international rescue effort in history continues .
The navy helicopters dispatched from the USS " Abraham Lincoln " were carrying out their second day of duties to airdrop relief materials and transport survivors in Aceh Indonesia .
Rear Admiral Crowder , commander of the Lincoln , said 50,000 pounds of food and water had been delivered to the disaster areas , and the mission was " going great . "
Political Tug-of-War Behind Tsunami Relief Efforts
While Asia 's tsunami relief supplies pour into the disaster areas , a less honorable activity is secretly underway as governments fight over who should give and who should receive , and who should lead the largest relief operation in modern times .
The disaster that caused almost 150,000 deaths has revived old battles , including the disagreements between the United States , the United Nations , and Europe , and the struggle for leadership in Asia .
However , relief experts still hold cautious hope that the global nature of this disaster that hit so many countries may set a precedent : governments honor their promises to help .
Juma , Professor of International Development at Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government said , " There has never been an aid pledge for which governments have come through 100 percent and on time . "
Donations pledged by governments have reached U.S. $ 2 billion . Important international figures including UN Secretary General Annan and U.S. Secretary of State Powell , as well as leaders of Australia , China , and Japan , will hold a crisis summit with rich political overtones in Jakarta on the 6th .
After allegations of a slow response and the open criticism by top UN Relief Official Egeland of rich countries for being ' stingy , ' U.S. President Bush has increased U.S. aid almost ten-fold to U.S. $ 350 million .
In Asia , the tsunami disaster has led to a covert race for regional influence . The increasingly confident China has pledged U.S. $ 60.5 million , a huge sum for a developing nation .
Japan , which has cut its foreign aid budget in six consecutive years , has also shattered talk of its declining national power by promising to provide at least U.S. $ 500 million , an amount that dwarfs all the other nations .
World Leaders to Tour Sri Lankan Disaster Areas
Sri Lankan officials stated that world leaders including UN Secretary General Annan and U.S. Secretary of State Powell have arrived in Sri Lanka successively to personally examine the tsunami disaster situation that claimed 30,600 lives in the country at the end of last month .
They said that Powell had arrived , while South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan was scheduled to arrive later that afternoon .
A press release issued by the U.S. Embassy said that Powell will visit some of the hardest-hit areas by the tsunami disaster of December 26 , including the southern region of Galle , where U.S. marines are stationed for relief operations .
The South Korean Embassy said that Lee Hae-Chan will be accompanied by the Sri Lankan Premier to tour the western coastlines .
The declaration said , " Together with Sri Lanka 's Premier Rajapakse , the Korean Prime Minister will travel along the western coast to have a first-hand view of the destruction of lives , livelihoods and property caused by the tsunami . "
Lee Hae-Chan will stop over at Hambantota , the hardest-hit area , to supervise the relief operations by Korean civilian and non-governmental organizations .
UN Secretary General Annan is set to arrive at night for a two-day visit .
Samarsinghe , spokesman for the United Nations , said , " He will be touring along with World Bank president Wolfensohn to some of the affected regions in the south and the east . "
Lee Jong-wook , the World Health Organization Director-General , is also set to arrive in Colombo today .
German Foreign Minister Fischer is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka by the weekend .
Sri Lankan officials said that more world leaders are set to arrive in the next few weeks .
Among those leaders is Canadian Prime Minister Martin . Canada announced yesterday that Marin will visit Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month .
Bush : U.S. Will Enhance Peace Efforts After Palestinian Election
U.S. President Bush said today that he was " heartened " by the strong turnout of today 's Palestinian election and promised that the U.S. would enhance peace efforts .
President Bush said in a statement , " Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza took a key step toward building a democratic future by choosing a new President of the autonomous government in the election .
Observers of the election described it as a largely free and fair election . "
He said , " This is a historic day for the Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East . "
Exit polls showed that former Prime Minister Abbas won the election with a landslide two thirds of the votes .
He will succeed Arafat to become the chairman of the Palestinian autonomous government .
Bush stated , " These efforts - including today 's presidential elections and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months - are essential for the establishment of a sovereign , independent , viable , democratic , and peaceful Palestinian state . This new state will ensure the safety of Israel . "
He said that the U.S. government looks forward to working with the newly elected chairman of the Palestinian autonomous government and the Palestinians in the advancement of the cause of Middle East peace .
Middle East peace meets the desire of the Israelis and Palestinians to coexist in peace and security .
Bush also called on Israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
He added , Arab states must " take concrete steps with all related parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , lend financial support to the Palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists . "
Annan 's Plan to Visit Sri Lankan Rebel-Held Regions Obstructed
UN Secretary General Annan said today that he hoped to return to Sri Lanka one day and " see all parts of the country . "
Annan just finished his two-day visit to tsunami-ravaged areas in Sri Lanka , but reports said that the Sri Lankan government once stopped him from visiting rebel-held northern areas .
When asked whether he was banned from visiting the rebel-held areas of the " Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam " as widely reported by many national newspapers , Annan said , " I 'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process . "
Annan said that President Kumaratunga was personally against his on-site visit to the guerrilla-controlled areas for fear that the rebels would use his visit as political capital .
He stated , " I raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the efforts .
I was also able to discuss that with President Kumaratunga . "
Annan 's failure to visit the northern rebel-held area of Jaffina had angered the residents . Several hundred people protested in front of the UN office in Jaffina .
However , the Sri Lankan government strongly denied the media report , saying that the media are " misleading " the issue .
On the other hand , while relief efforts are in full swing , the Sri Lankan Meteorological Department warned that its coastline may be hit by a cyclone that is currently building off its coast .
Russian Space Agency Denies Rocket Fuel Causes Illnesses in Children
The weekly-published British science journal Nature reported that the highly toxic rocket fuel shot out during Russia 's launch of space shuttles at Kazakhstan 's Baikonur Space Base is causing serous illnesses in nearby children , but Russian space agency Rosaviakosmos denied the allegation today .
The issue of Nature published today quoted research as saying that the levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents of the polluted areas are twice as high as that in general areas .
This research was conducted by a group of Russian scientists headed by epidemiologist Zykov .
Rosaviakosmos responded , " No direct influence of space-related activities on the population 's health has so far been established . "
This research , cited in Nature , focused on children in the Altai Republic .
The Altai Republic is located in the mountainous region on the southern border of Siberia .
The Altai Republic was chosen as the research subject because of the pollution from unburnt fuel , especially hydrazine .
Part of Russian 's space launch missions used hydrazine as fuel in the early stages .
Zykov compared the health records of approximately 1,000 children in the two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with 3,300 health records of children from nearby unpolluted areas in the control group .
Nature reported that Zykov concluded that children from the worst-polluted areas who require medical treatment are twice as many as the unpolluted control group and their treatment time is twice as long .
White House Says Iraqi Election Won 't be Flawless
The White House admitted today that the Iraqi election scheduled for January 30 is " not going to be perfect . " Meanwhile , two car bomb attacks happened in Mosul , Iraq , killing at least two Iraqi soldiers .
When asked whether he agreed with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi , that violence would prevent some Iraqi areas from voting , White House Spokesman McClellan said , " We all recognize that the election is not going to be perfect . "
He said , " This is the first time Iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders . It 's for a transitional government , and it 's one of three elections that will take place over the course of this year . "
McClellan stated , " And so we 're going to do everything we can to help the Iraqi people and the interim government ensure as broad a participation as possible in this upcoming election . "
Violent clashes broke out in Iraq on the 11th , killing at least 25 people , six of whom died in a car bomb attack that happened in ex-President Hussein 's hometown of Tikrit . Under such conditions , Allawi acknowledged that some Iraqi areas would not be able to take part in this month 's election .
Meanwhile , two car bomb attacks happened in Mosul , Iraq , today , killing at least two Iraqi soldiers .
U.S. Army Sergeant Schaeffer told the AFP that a truck exploded before it tried to attack a joint convoy of U.S. and Iraqi military vehicles , killing an unknown number of civilians .
Schaeffer said that another vehicle parked across the street exploded and killed two Iraqi soldiers .
U.S. November Trade Deficit Hits Record High of $ 60 Billion
Figures announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that U.S. exports shrunk 2.3 percent last November , sending the trade deficit to a record high of U.S. $ 60.3 billion .
U.S. exports fell to a five-month low of U.S. $ 95.6 billion . Meanwhile , as U.S. imported oil rose to U.S. $ 14.2 billion , an increase of over U.S. $ 2 billion or 1.3 percent , imports thus increased by 1.3 percent , reaching an all-time high of U.S. $ 155.8 billion .
The trade deficit increased by 7.7 percent from last October 's revised U.S. $ 56 billion and a huge 50.8 percent increase from U.S. $ 40 billion in November the year before .
According to a survey conducted by CBS MarketWatch , Wall Street economists expected the trade deficit on goods and services would drop to around U.S. $ 53.3 billion .
Despite a weak U.S. dollar that makes goods produced in the U.S. cheaper at home and abroad , the U.S. trade deficit continues to expand .
The report released by the Commerce Department today will add pressure on the dollar and revive appeals for Washington to take action in U.S. energy independence and the resolution of the U.S.-China trade imbalance .
A drop in U.S. exports last November was caused by a reduction of U.S. $ 1.4 billion in capital goods , including U.S. $ 325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines .
Industrial materials exports , mostly energy , fell by U.S. $ 800 million .
Automobile , consumer goods , and food exports also fell .
Japanese Defense Agency Director-General : Remembers Militarist Past , Respects Neighboring Countries ' Dignity
Japanese Defense Agency Director-General Ono Yoshinori stated today that while Japan adopts a higher international profile , it will not forget its militarist past and will remember the " dignity " of neighboring Asian countries .
When asked about the uneasiness caused by Japan 's deployment of the Self-Defense Forces to South Asian tsunami disaster areas , Ono said , " While we get along with Southeast Asian nations , we should never forget the past . "
He told reporters , " We must build relations with friendly countries so that we can tell them that we have good intentions .
We should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while looking at the past as it was . "
Ono specifically mentioned that this year marked the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War . He said , " We want to be reborn and cooperate for the sake of a new era . "
Ono just finished his visit to several South Asian tsunami-ravaged countries . He said that he felt the " dignity " of an independent nation when the Indonesian leader told him that the Japanese Self-Defense Forces should finish their rescue mission no later than the end of March .
The United Nations has voiced its concern over the deadline imposed by the Indonesian government on foreign troops .
Foreign troops received broad credit for rescuing tsunami survivors in remote areas .
Close to 1,000 Japanese Self-Defense personnel are heading toward countries hit by the tsunami of December 26 . Over 163,000 people died in this natural disaster .
This is the biggest deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces since the end of the Second World War .
The post-war constitution in Japan dominated by the United States prohibits the use of force by the Self-Defense Forces .
Political Intervention in NHK Program . Japanese Media Touch Off Debates
According to rumors , NHK toned down a program about women who were forced by the Japanese army to become prostitutes during the Second World War that aired a few years ago , due to pressure from political figures . Japanese liberal media thus launched a dispute with their conservative colleagues on the issue .
According to sources , NHK cut the majority of the interview contents in the program after discussing it with top politicians . Most of the interviewees were critics of Japanese wartime behavior and victims who were forced to become prostitutes . NHK 's action had solicited criticism from the liberal media .
Nonetheless , conservative newspapers defended NHK 's decision to revise the contents of the program , stating that the company 's senior officials had the responsibility to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the program 's contents .
The dispute , which focused on a program aired in 2001 about a mock trial of the crime committed by the Japanese army of forcing women to become prostitutes during the war , erupted last week .
The trial was held by a Japanese women 's rights group in December 2000 . The verdict found late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the Japanese army to commandeer prostitutes during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries .
Historians said that at least 200,000 young women were forced to become prostitutes at frontline Japanese brothels during the war . Most of them came from Korea , but there were also women from Taiwan , China , the Philippines , and Indonesia .
The program 's producer , Nagai Satoru , blew the whistle in a tearful press conference on the 13th , saying that before the program was aired , NHK top officials had met with Senators Abe and Nakagawa of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party , who showed concern over the program contents .
According to Nagai , NHK top officials then re-edited the program and watered down its contents .
He said , " NHK bowed to political pressures . "
Abe and Nakagawa admitted that they had met with NHK personnel and told them that they had to be " fair " , but strongly denied that they had exerted pressure on the company .
Eurozone Indicators Show Core Inflation under Control
Economists said today that eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation remains under control .
Meanwhile , both Eurozone industrial output and French consumer spending are expected to fall .
It is expected that the European Union 's Statistics service will confirm the inflation rate is up a little from 2.2 percent in November to 2.3 percent in December when it releases inflation figures on the 20th .
But the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases , while the core inflation rate is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .
Core inflation figures and consumer price index figures will be released together .
Economists pointed out that core inflation , which excludes food , energy , tobacco , and alcohol prices , has remained at 1.6 to 2.0 percent for the past two years .
European Central Bank President Trichet stated on the 13th that short-term price pressures have dropped recently .
Although inflation will remain above 2 percent in the next few months , a decrease is expected by the end of the year .
Meanwhile , another economist stated that a decrease in eurozone November industrial output to be released on the 18th is expected due to a slowdown in growth in Germany .
German industrial output dropped 1.7 percent in November while economists surveyed by AFP 's financial news subsidiary expected that eurozone output would decrease by 0.4 percent in November after a drop of 0.5 percent in October .
Schmieding of the Bank of America said that eurozone output may rebound in December .
Bureaucracy Blows Second Strike to Tsunami Victims
Three weeks after the assault of the worst tsunami in history , survivors are fighting pernicious habits of red tape and politicking . Meanwhile , the world focus has shifted elsewhere .
Thousands of decomposed bodies are continuously being unearthed from the rubble , bringing the death toll of the December 26 tsunami to over 168,000 people . At the same time , the approaching Iraqi election and President Bush 's inauguration have replaced the tsunami as the headlines of the global media .
Indonesia originally ordered foreign troops who engaged in humanitarian missions to withdraw within three months but later rescinded this demand .
In Thailand , the leaders of Canada , Sweden , Norway , and Finland are meeting to discuss the reconstruction and body-identification work .
Nonetheless , the survivors are facing new challenges such as the delay in the distribution of relief materials that poured in from around the world , caused by the deep-rooted bureaucracy in Indonesia .
Busriadi , a fisherman from a small village near Banda Aceh , the capital of Aceh on Sumatra Island in Indonesia , said , " We are like people who do not exist . We have been hit hard by the disaster , lost everything , and are famished . "
He stated , " Where is the food , the clothes , and other relief we see on television flowing into Aceh ? "
Like thousands of other victims , Busriadi lost his identification card and other official documents , thus turning his efforts in getting aid into a nightmare .
Despite his pleading with officials and bustling about everyday going through the formalities , the result is the same : no aid .
Zeng Qinghong Believed to Have Visited Zhao Ziyang at His Death Bed
The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights in China stated that Zeng Qinghong , Vice President of the People 's Republic of China , visited the deposed former Party Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party , Zhao Ziyang , at the hospital before he passed away this morning .
The information center said that according to Zhao 's family , Zen Qinghong visited Zhao at a Beijing hospital at 6 a.m. today . Zhao passed away about an hour later , at the age of 85 .
Zhao Ziyang was once the Party Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party and the Prime Minister . He was ousted in 1989 for his opposition to the suppression by force of the democratic movement in Tiananmen Square . He was later held under house arrest and was considered an unwelcome figure by the government .
The information center said that according to Zhao 's family , the current Premier , Wen Jiabao , who was once under Zhao , did not visit him when he was terminally ill .
Nonetheless , before Zhao Ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th , Tian Jiyun , a retired Central Committee member who was once Zhao 's assistance , went to visit him .
The Information Center for Human Rights in China has kept contact with Zhao 's family and has been releasing timely and accurate information on Zhao Ziyang 's situation for years .
The information center indicated that approximately 20 retired key members of the Party , the government , and the army planned to issue an open letter to the Chinese Communist Party calling for the reevaluation of Zhao Ziyang 's contributions and asking to hold a public memorial service for him .
The center added that Zhao 's family would not be allowed to hold or make arrangements for the funeral ; all final decisions on related arrangements will be made by the Party .
Liang Baiqi , Zhao Ziyang 's wife , is 86 years old .
The information center said that she had not been told of her husband 's death until this evening due to the poor condition of her health .
Democratization Urged in China after Zhao Ziyang 's Death
After former Chinese Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang died of an illness today , people around the world spoke highly of him while Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro , the Taiwan government , and overseas Chinese democratic figures all called on Beijing to implement Zhao Ziyang 's democratic reform ideas .
Zhao Ziyang was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square democratic movement and had spent the rest of his life under house arrest . He passed away in a Beijing hospital this morning at the age of 85 .
According to Jiji News Services , Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi said , " I want them ( China ) to make efforts at democratization " while mourning Zhao Ziyang 's death .
Taiwan also urged China to implement democratic and political reforms after the death of Zhao Ziyang .
Overseas Chinese democratic figures praised Zhao Ziyang as " one of China 's greatest reformers " who sacrificed his own political career to oppose the bloody crackdown on the democratic movement in Tiananmen Square .
Lian Shengde , a former student movement leader and the president of the New York-based Free China Movement , said , " During his 15 years under house arrest , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward the rule of law and democracy .
Zhao Ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle . "
Some democratic figures asked the Chinese government to hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and to provide fair assessments of his achievements .
However , they admitted that Zhao Ziyang would not receive such courteous treatment , since the Chinese government fears that people who are dissatisfied with Communist rule will use this opportunity to stir up riots .
The 1989 student movement was provoked by the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang .
Xinhua News Agency published a brief report today saying that Comrade Zhao Ziyang died of an illness in a Beijing hospital . This was the only official statement on the matter .
UN : Rich Countries Fail to Honor Poverty Reduction Promise
A panel of UN-appointed experts said in a new report that rich countries have fallen short in their promises to provide financial assistance in order to reduce by half the population of the world living in extreme poverty by 2015 .
Rich nations worldwide have committed themselves to the UN 's ambitious " Millennium Development Goals " project to improve the fate of the poor and suffering in the world .
However , with more than 1 billion people worldwide living on less than U.S. $ 1 a day and 2.7 billion surviving on less than U.S. $ 2 per day , UN experts noted that time is running out for the rich nations to honor their word .
Brown , head of the UN Development Program , said , " With the proper mobilization of resources and political will , and reform in developing countries as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achievable . "
UN experts stated that 22 rich nations in the world have promised to provide 0.7 percent of their gross national product to assist developing countries , but that at present , they are only offering 0.25 percent .
UN Secretary General Annan commissioned development experts headed by former Harvard economist Sachs to prepare the report on the progress of the goals , which include eliminating extreme poverty , making primary education universal , lowering the child mortality rate , and fighting HIV / AIDS and other fatal diseases .
The report said , " Practical solutions exist . The political framework has been established . And for the first time , the cost is utterly affordable . All that is needed is action . "
UN Announces Implementation of Global Disaster Alert System
The United Nations announced that a global disaster alert system will be set up to prevent major natural disasters .
However , following the South Asian tsunami disaster , there are still debates on which country 's technology should be used in this disaster system .
At the end of a global meeting held in Kobe , Japan , by several UN agencies , a joint statement was issued stating that UN experts will set up a global disaster alert system to reduce the damages caused by major natural disasters .
The huge catastrophe caused by the South Asian tsunami had enraged countries around the Indian Ocean .
Briceno , Director of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , said , " The new program will bring peace and safety to mankind .
An effective early warning system will protect the life and safety of millions of people worldwide . "
However , the UN statement was mostly symbolic .
UNESCO officials stated that more important talks are still required for this disaster alert system .
UNESCO is heading the establishment of a global disaster alert system .
Bernal , head of UNESCO 's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission , said , " Right now we have several proposals that are completely uncoordinated by different countries . What we need to do is to coordinate them . "
Bernal said that the commission will hold two meetings in 60 days , hoping that a decision on which tsunami alert system to use can be reached in these two meetings .
One of the meetings will take place in Paris while the other is yet to be determined .
Bernal hopes that the decision can be finalized in July and that the global disaster alert system can be ready in mid-2006 , a target date set by UNESCO .
Beijing HIV / AIDS Patients Increase 40 Percent a Year
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 1 ( Zhao Xinpei , Li Xun ) - The Beijing Health Ministry announced the newest figure of HIV / AIDS carriers in Beijing a few days ago : From 1985 to October 2004 , an accumulated total of 2,046 HIV / AIDS cases were reported in Beijing and the number is increasing at an average annual rate of 40.6 percent .
The state HIV / AIDS statistics data showed that the number of HIV / AIDS carriers reported in Beijing is the eighth highest in the nation .
Among the 2,046 HIV / AIDS carriers , 403 are Beijing residents , 1,507 are floating population from other parts of the country , 106 are foreigners , and 30 are people with unknown address .
According to analysis , Beijing residents contracted HIV / AIDS mostly through intravenous drug abuse and sexual transmission , the floating population contracted HIV / AIDS mainly through intravenous drug abuse and blood transfers , while foreigners contracted HIV / AIDS mainly through sexual transmission .
In order to stop HIV / AIDS from further spreading , free consultation offices and antibody screening labs have been set up by the Center for Disease Control in the 18 districts and counties in Beijing since July 2004 to launch face-to-face consultation , initial blood screening , and epidemiological study . The programs will be gradually expanded to hospitals grade-2 or above across the city .
The Beijing Health Ministry has assigned Di Tan Hospital and You An Hospital as designated hospitals for free HIV / AIDS treatment in Beijing . These hospitals are responsible for the clinical portion of the free HIV / AIDS treatment . The required medicine reagents will be centrally coordinated and purchased by the Beijing Health Ministry and the municipal financial department .
The Beijing Commission of Education has drawn up a free educational policy for HIV / AIDS carriers and their children , as well as the schooling policy for HIV / AIDS carriers among teenage students .
At present , grade-2 and above hospitals across the city that are equipped with gynecology and obstetrics wards will assume the responsibilities of free HIV / AIDS consultation and screening , while Di Tan Hospital and You An Hospital will provide antiviral medical treatment for pregnant women .
Currently , 1,390 automatic condom vending machines have been installed in some areas at no charge . Among intravenous drug addicts , Methadone maintenance treatment has been launched and pilot locations for clean needle exchange have been established .
Shanghai Power Generating Equipment Output and Production Capacity Leap to World Best
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , December 1 ( Reporter Jiang Wei ) - With the completion of the trial run of a 660,000-kilowatt power-generating unit , Shanghai Turbine Generator Co . , Ltd , a subsidiary of Shanghai Electric Group , reached its annual production target of 15 million-kilowatt units on the 1st , a date earlier than planned . The achievement thus enabled Shanghai to leap to lead the world in both output and production capacity of power plant equipment and fulfilled the wish of several generations of the Chinese equipment manufacturing industry .
Shanghai Electric Group is the largest power plant equipment-manufacturing base in China .
With the rapid growth in the demand for power-generating equipment in China in recent years , power generator manufacturers across the country have entered a phase marked by huge growth and major development .
Shanghai Electric Group consolidated the favorable resources of power plant equipment including steam turbines and power plant boilers . After undertaking the production of four million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generating units , it has also acquired production orders for nine heavy-duty fuel-powered electric generating units and three waste heat boilers through a combined bidding .
Meanwhile , through an integrated operation , it has further enhanced its business management , technology development , and production efficiency .
At present , Shanghai Electric Group holds 40 percent of the market share for the Chinese power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas markets in the Middle East , Southeast Asia , and South America .
This year alone , Shanghai Turbine Generator Co . , Ltd has received a RMB 6 billion yuan sales order for the main engine components of the power generating equipment .
Zheng Jianhua , president of Shanghai Electric Group , said that the " power shortage " this summer had boosted the demand for power plant equipment across the country . The competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is gradually becoming white-hot .
The group is putting into practice its three objectives of " developing and producing million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generation , gas turbine generating units , and million-kilowatt grade nuclear power " in order to achieve its goal of rising to the world 's 500 strongest as soon as possible .
( Hong Kong , Macau , Taiwan ) Hong Kong Observatory to Provide New Services for WMO
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , December 12 - The Hong Kong Observatory will launch two new services for the " World Weather Information Service " and " Severe Weather Information Center " websites hosted by the World Meteorological Organization , starting December 2 .
A spokesman for the observatory said that the two new services are to add a global official weather observation of cloudiness and rain to the " World Weather Information Service " website and a recap function to display the tropical cyclone paths for the past seven days on the " Severe Weather Information Center " website .
These two programs are another new service that the Hong Kong Observatory is offering after it started providing the " Severe Weather Information Center " with official observation information of heavy rain ( including snow ) in areas around the world earlier this year .
According to information , the " World Weather Information Service " website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for the world 's major cities .
The new service , for the first time , provides global official weather observations with the cloudiness and rain distribution map as its first project introduced .
The weather observation information on the new web page has a wide coverage and a high density , with eight scheduled updates per day .
The new product of the " Severe Weather Information Center " website is to provide a recap function for displaying tropical cyclone paths .
The previous design was that once the tropical cyclone dissipated , information including the location of the tropical cyclone would no longer be saved on the website .
However , the public often still wants to obtain related information about the tropical cyclone a few days after it makes landfall .
As a result , the new product will store information on the intensities , locations , and paths of tropical cyclones that have happened in the past seven days so the public and the media can still obtain desired information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated .
World 's First Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Strain Rapid Diagnostic Kit Successfully Developed in Shantou
Xinhua News Agency , Shantou , December 3 ( Reporters Zhang Yiwen , Lin Juniang ) - Reporters obtained information from Shantou University Medical College / The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center that after almost six months of collaboration with Xiamen University , they have developed the world 's first rapid diagnostic kit for the bird flu virus H5N1 strain .
A confirmation of whether a person has contracted the bird flu virus can be obtained in as little as an hour by testing a specimen from the suspected carrier with this rapid diagnostic method .
According to Professor Guan Yi , director of Shantou University / The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center , based on the information available now , bird flu , which is listed as a highly fatal pathogenic virus , has a case fatality rate much higher than the SARS virus .
In the past , it would take three to five days or even more than a week to confirm a " suspected " case of virus infection .
The successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technique uses Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay techniques . Testable specimens include excrement , nasal or throat secretions , intact virus cultivated from chicken embryo , virus isolate , or serum . A confirmation of bird flu virus infection can be reached in as soon as an hour or within two hours at the latest .
The new technique has the characteristics of being simple , convenient , and fast . Testing can be conducted at the outbreak site with an accuracy rate of over 90 percent . It can help the early discovery , diagnosis , quarantine , and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent a widespread and major disaster .
Commissioned by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Shantou University Medical College / The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center recently held a training workshop on bird flu testing techniques to train students from disease control and prevention centers in 20 provinces and cities across the country . The newest bird flu virus rapid detection technique was also included in the course content .
Spokesman for the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong Denounces U.S. House International Relations Committee Chairman Hyde 's Speech
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , December 3 - A spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region released a statement on the 3rd strongly denouncing the speech made yesterday by Hyde , Chairman of the U.S. House International Relations Committee , in Hong Kong .
The spokesman claimed that China had expressed its strong displeasure with the speech delivered by Mr. Hyde , Chairman of the U.S. House International Relations Committee , in Hong Kong on December 2 , which contained malicious attacks on China 's development and progress , and tarnished China 's foreign policy with his Cold War mentality .
The spokesman stated that people in the world know that not only is China 's development in line with the basic interests of 1.3 billion Chinese , it is also beneficial to the world 's prosperity and advancement .
In the international political arena , China is a responsible country that has contributed positively and constructively to uphold world peace and stability .
On the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , China has strictly enforced the international agreements and is opposed to any form of nuclear proliferation , and is advocating resolving these problems through negotiations , talks , and enhanced international monitoring .
The spokesman stated that it was regretful that Mr. Hyde ignored the objective facts and issued such irresponsible statements at a time when the Sino-US relationship is heading towards healthy and stable progress . His statements contradicted the recent consensus in developing bilateral ties , reached by the state leaders of China and the U.S. They are running counter to the demand of mainstream U.S. society for enhancing the cooperative relationship with China , and will certainly harm the development of the Sino-US relationship .
China 's Largest Seawater Desalination Project Begins in Zhoushan
Xinhua News Agency , Hangzhou , December 6 ( Pan Yifeng , Xu Qun ) - The largest seawater desalination project ever in China , with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons , will begin in Putuo District , Zhoushan City of Zhejiang Province .
For Zhoushan residents , who suffer greatly from water shortages , the vast and mighty seawater that has been flowing by their side for hundreds and thousands of years will soon become clear and sweet tap water that runs into tens of thousands of households .
Information gathered by reporters from relevant departments showed that Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and Liuheng Township government in Putuo District of Zhoushan City signed the cooperation agreement for a 10,000-ton seawater desalination project a few days ago .
The investment for the project is RMB 50 million yuan with a daily fresh water production capacity of 10,000 tons . Its treatment scale is the largest among all seawater desalination projects in China thus far . The first stage of the project is expected to be completed next year .
Zhoushan City is one of the Chinese cities that suffers the most from water shortages .
There are 1,390 islands of varying sizes in the city . On average , each person has 601 cubic meters of fresh water , only 25.4 percent of that of Zhejiang Province . Drinking water has always been a problem that affects the residents ' lives in this island city .
For instance , Liuheng Town in Putuo District has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day at a cost of more than RMB 10 yuan per ton .
The reverse osmosis seawater desalination technology developed by Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration is a membrane diffusion process powered by pressure and is the focus in today 's international seawater desalination research domain .
The relevant leading official of the center said that through the technological enhancement and improvement of equipment inside China , the cost for the reverse osmosis seawater desalination project and its energy consumption have both been lowered .
The cost for each ton of seawater desalination treatment will be further reduced from the existing RMB 5 yuan .
It indicates that the cost for seawater desalination will hopefully approach the price of tap water and industrial use water .

( International ) Andean Community Presidential Council Holds Special Meeting in Peru
Xinhua News Agency , Cusco ( Peru ) , December 7 ( Reporters Liu Guoqiang , Wang Lu ) - The Andean Community Presidential Council Special Meeting opened in the famous tourist city of Cusco , Peru , on the 7th .
Participating presidents and representatives will exchange views on issues including the deepening of the Andean region 's integration plan and the boosting of economic and social developments .
Peruvian President Toledo delivered a speech at the inauguration , stating that the Andean Community has been established for 35 years but major problems such as poverty are still unresolved .
The current poverty rate in the Andean region is as high as 53 percent , which poses a serious threat to democratic governance in the region .
As a result , governments of the Andean Community have to try their best to find and establish an effective mechanism to shake off poverty and to strengthen people 's participation in state affairs in order to enhance social stability and development .
Toledo noted that , despite the many problems that required resolving within the Andean Community , the Latin American integration process has achieved tremendous progress in recent years . The establishment of the South American Community will be announced at the third South American State Leaders Meeting to be held here on the 8th .
He believes that the birth of this new regional organization will play an important role in promoting political , economic , and social developments in the region .
Apart from Toledo , Bolivian President Mesa was also present at the meeting .
Due to various reasons , Colombian President Uribe , Ecuadorian President Gutierrez , and Venezuelan President Chavez could not attend the meeting , but they will be present at the third South American State Leaders Meeting to be held here on the 8th .

The Presidential Council is the highest decision-making body of the Andean Community and holds its meeting annually .
The last meeting was held in July 2003 in Quito , the capital city of Ecuador .
Three Gorges Dam Underground Power Station Construction Begins Soon
Xinhua News Agency , Wuhan , December 8 ( Reporter Shi Yongfeng ) - December 8 . An invitation for a public bid for the principal construction of the underground power station of the Three Gorges Dam is underway for the first time , thus marking the inauguration of the construction project .
The Three Gorges Dam Project plans to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydro turbine-generating units with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts . The average annual power generated after the entire unit goes into operation will be 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours .
In order to further develop the power generating potential of the Three Gorges Dam Project , a space for the construction of an underground power station was reserved in advance in its initial design .
According to a top official of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corp. , the underground power station of the Three Gorges Dam is located inside the mountains , to the right side of the great dam . Its main structures include an intake tower , diversion canal , main powerhouse , tailwater system , vertical shafts , and a 500-kilovolt transformer substation .
Six 700,000kw-generator units will be installed in the underground power station .
In this case , the total number of generators installed in the Three Gorges Dam Project will be increased from the original 26 to 32 units while the installed capacity will be increased from 18.2 million kilowatts to 22.4 million kilowatts , thus greatly improving the power generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam Project .
Flood control is the priority mission for the Three Gorges Dam Project .
According to the Three Gorges reservoir operation adjustment plan , every year before the flood season , the water retention level inside the Three Gorges reservoir will be operated at the lowered flood control limit level of 145 meters , from its normal 175 meters level .
Thus , the construction of the underground power station will increase the water utilization index of the Three Gorges reservoir , reduce water wastage and increase power-generating capacity in order to maximize the impounding stream peak adjustment period of the power station .
Currently , early construction projects of the Three Gorges Dam underground power station , including the digging of branch tunnels and tailwater ditches , as well as the construction of the prop-ups , have begun .
According to sources , the underground power station will be completed and go into operation by the end of 2008 .
China Set for Nautical Fair
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 8 ( Reporter Huang Fuhui ) Yao Mingde , Chairman of the China Road Transport Association , expressed at a press conference held here on the 8th that he was " very confident " that a China Nautical Fair will be established .
Yao Mingde , who was also the Chairman of the Office of the Organizing Leading Group of Zheng He 's 600 Anniversaries to the West Commemorative Activities , stated that 16 organizing leading groups including the Ministry of Transportation had all agreed to set every July 11 , the day of Zheng He 's first expedition to the West , as the Nautical Fair in China and will suggest that the state establish such a fair .
According to sources , the establishment of any festival that does not require a day off should be approved by the State Council .
Zheng He was a world-renowned mariner .
In the 28 years between 1405 and 1433 , Zheng He led more than 200 fleets and close to 30,000 people to cross the vast ocean seven times through Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and Africa , sailing more than 300,000 kilometers and visited over 30 countries and regions in Asia and Africa .
China will hold a series of commemorative activities next year to celebrate the 600th Anniversary of Zheng He 's expedition to the West .
The logo of the commemorative activities was announced in Beijing on the 8th .
The logo was made up of a westbound sailboat braving the wind and waves , churning arc-shaped spindrifts in light blue color , and words that say " Zheng He 's 600th Anniversary to the West , 1405-2005 . "
The designer was Yao Ying , an art teacher at a high school in Xi 'an City of Shan 'xi Province .
People in society all urged that China should seize the commemoration of Zheng Hen 's 600th Anniversary to the West in 2005 and the opportunity to enhance the education of minors to establish the Nautical Fair in order to raise people 's nautical awareness and their oceanic concepts , to pass on the spirit of the Chinese nation , and to intensify education in patriotism .
Yao Mingde stated that China has over 3 million square kilometers of maritime space and in China 's international trade , 90 percent of the goods involved in the transactions are completed through maritime shipping .
China is a big nautical country in the world and not having a nautical fair among all the festivals is wrong .
Taiwan Province has already established July 11 as the Nautical Fair .

Xinhua News Agency , Abidjan , December 8 ( Reporter Liu Shaoping ) - The United Nations Mission in the Ivory Coast released a public statement in Abidjan on the night of the 8th , stating that UN Secretary General Annan expressed his welcome for the consensus reached among all parties in the continuous implementation of the peace agreement . He urged all parties to seize this opportunity to ensure that " true progress " would be achieved in the peace process in order to prepare for the October 2005 election .
The public statement stated that Annan also stressed that all parties should reach a general agreement on the " concrete action roadmap . "
He also " had high hopes " for the continuous efforts of South African President Mbeki and the African Union to join hands with the Economic Community of West African States and the United Nations Mission in the Ivory Coast to resolve the crisis in the Ivory Coast .
Commissioned by the African Union , Mbeki conducted a four-day visit in the Ivory Coast from December 2 to 6 to seek a resolution for the crisis in the area .
Mbeki announced at the end of his visit that all parties in the Ivory Coast had reached a consensus on the four suggestions .
The suggestions included : to finish a relevant law enactment of the Marcoussis peace agreement , to disarm belligerent personnel , that all government ministers return to their posts to fulfill their duties , and to regain safety inside the Ivory Coast .
Parliamentary party chairs from the Ivory Coast decided in a meeting a few days ago that the parliament would start deliberations on relevant proposals on the constitutional reform starting the 10th .
Opposition rebels in the Ivory Coast also announced on the 8th that their leaders would hold a meeting in the near future to have an overall evaluation of the peace roadmap and to discuss the issue of disarmament .
A coup and a civil war broke out in the Ivory Coast in September 2002 .
During last January and this July , major political parties in the Ivory Coast and representatives of opposition rebel parties reached an agreement in France and Ghana respectively to resume peace and bring about national reconciliation .
However , implementation of the agreements has met with many obstacles , and the peace process thus suffered repeated setback .
Opposition rebels , who control the northern regions of the Ivory Coast , announced in mid-October that they would recall their participatory representatives . The peace process in the Ivory Coast thus reached another impasse .
In early November , a serious clash occurred between the Ivory Coast army and the French army stationed in the country . The incident caused further deterioration of the country 's situation .

Experts Suggest Establishment of News Spokesman System for Minors in China
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , December 13 ( Reporter Liu Dan ) - The " Forum on Social Education for Chinese Youth 2004 - The Media and the Development of Minors " that closed on the 13th in Shanghai suggested that China should establish a news spokesman system related to the situation of minors to release regular information on the current developmental situation of minors and the issues encountered .

About half of the arrangements for minors ' after-school time involve the media . The media has become a factor affecting the growth and development of minors with an entirely new social force that cannot be ignored .
" The media is a window that connects the souls of minors with the outside world . Once the window is opened , while fresh air comes in , flies and mosquitoes will also enter , "
Chen Tianqiao , President of Shanghai Chengda Network Development Company , Ltd. said .
At the same time , the media is creating good conditions for the healthy growth of minors , due to market competition and the need for economic benefits , as well as the low quality of some news professionals ; the viewpoints in scripts may easily mislead the thinking and value systems of the youth , while some media even disseminate violent and pornographic content .
There are currently more than 2,000 television channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies that run 1,868 broadcast programs , and the number of Internet users in China has reached 87 million people .
Relevant officials of the forum stated that the establishment of a news spokesman system for minors can supply authoritative study materials for the current situation and issues encountered in youth development , so that the media " nonsense talk " situation can be corrected and a beneficial public opinion environment for the growth of minors can be provided .
( International ) Iraqi Foreign Minister Believes Three Major Problems Lie Ahead after the Iraqi Election
Xinhua News Agency , Dubai ( United Arab Emirates ) December 14 ( Reporters Xing Xu , Dong Yanyi ) - Al-Zebari , Foreign Minister of the Iraqi interim government , said in Dubai on the 14th that three major problems lie ahead following the Iraqi election to be held on January 30 of next year .

He said he believed that the future Iraqi government would be a legitimate government that represents Iraqis and that expresses their will .
Al-Zebari claimed that the Coalition forces headed by the United States were asked to stay and provide protection in Iraq by the Iraqi authorities because the current Iraqi interim government cannot control the security situation and eradicate the terrorists and saboteurs .
There is a time limit for the occupation of the Coalition forces . According to the United Nations Resolution , it will end once Iraq finishes its political process and a legitimate government is formed .
Al-Zebari stressed that the new Iraq will preserve its Arabic and Islamic attributes and will abide by the constitution of the Arab League .
The Iraqis are presented with the opportunity to rebuild their country on a new foundation . Iraq will rise again and become an important member of the large Arab family that can contribute to its own people .

( International ) UN Warns of Rise of Global Drug-Related Deaths in 2005
Xinhua News Agency , Vienna , December 17 ( Reporter Song Guocheng ) - Costa , Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime , warned in a press release on the 17th that because of the increase in heroin production in Afghanistan , it is expected that the global price of heroin on the black market is going to stabilize and the pureness will increase , thus resulting in the deaths of more drug addicts .
Costa has already issued warnings to officials of health and anti-drug agencies in Europe and its surrounding countries and called on these countries to pay close attention to the newest trends in Afghanistan drug cultivation and international drug-related crimes and to adopt relevant measures .
According to the statistics numbers provided by the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime , headquartered in Vienna , when the opium cultivation industry in Afghanistan was banned in 2001 , heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94 percent and the pureness of black market heroin in Europe decreased by 50 percent the following year .
In 2000 and 2002 , the number of drug related deaths in Europe dropped by 20 percent .
Costa said that the area for heroin cultivation in Afghanistan increased by 64 percent this year , compared to 2003 . Heroin production has reached more than 500 tons , higher than the annual transaction amount on the world heroin black market . This trend indicates that the global pureness of the drug will be higher and there will be a corresponding increase in drug-related deaths .
Costa believed that Afghanistan as a drug source poses a " clear and present danger " to global anti-drug efforts . The increase in the supply of black market heroin implies a " death sentence " for drug addicts .
According to estimates , approximately 100,000 people in the world die from drug overdoses each year .
( International ) U.S. Army Confirms Another Guantanamo Prisoner Not Enemy-Combatant
Xinhua News Agency , Washington , December 20 ( Reporters Pan Yunzhao , Tan Xinmu ) - U.S. Department of Defense Navy Secretary Gordon England said in a press conference at the Pentagon on the 20th that an army investigative panel had confirmed that a prisoner at the Guantanamo U.S. Navy Base was not an enemy combatant and would soon be released .
This was the second Guantanamo prisoner determined by the U.S. army not to be an enemy combatant .
England said that the Pentagon confirmed this prisoner 's status a day or two ago . The State Department would notify the prisoner 's home country and arrange for his release .
Nevertheless , he did not reveal the name and nationality of the prisoner and did not explain under what conditions he was captured .
England refused to admit that the Department of Defense had made a mistake in determining the identity of the Guantanamo prisoner .
He stated that the army investigative panel in charge of reviewing the status of the Guantanamo prisoners had conducted reviews of 507 prisoners and determined the identities of 230 people ; the enemy-combatant status of 228 pf these people was correct .
To date , the United States has released approximately 200 Guantanamo prisoners . After their return to their home countries , some of them were released , while a small number of them remain in prison , but at least 12 of them have taken part in fighting the U.S. army again after their release .
Currently , 550 suspected members of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban , many of whom were captured during the U.S-Afghanistan War , are being locked up at the Guantanamo U.S. Navy Base .
The U.S. government called these people enemy combatants and not POWs , thus they are not protected by the Geneva Convention .
Many countries have criticized the United States of detaining their citizens indefinitely while some international organizations also denounce the way the U.S. government handles this matter as a violation of international law .
State Domain Name Top-Level Node Settles in Shanghai
Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , December 21 ( Reporters Feng Yizhen , Chen Haiyu ) - December 21 . The China Internet Network Information Center and the Shanghai Information Industry Group signed a contract on locating the state domain name top-level node in Shanghai .
A domain name is the communication basis for all Internet applications including the conducting of electronic business and electronic government affairs . At present , it is widely used for Internet addresses .
Users have to enter the domain name before visiting websites or receiving electronic mail . Through the decoding service of the domain name system , the domain name will be converted into an IP address and find the host computer of the website to enable the information transfer .
Just like the " nervous system , " a domain name system controls information transmission on the Internet .
Mao Wei , Director of China Internet Network Information Center , which manages China 's state top-level domain name system , explained that to date , China has the second highest number of Internet users in the world with over 90 million people . The number of websites has topped 650,000 .
The decoding capacity of the domain name is in direct proportion to the usage of the Internet . With the rapid expansion of the Internet , the decoding capacity of the domain name is also developing at top speed .
Currently , the registration volume of the domain name " CN " is increasing at a rate of 10,000 per month and has reached 430,000 .
The state top-level domain name server hosted and managed by the China Internet Network Information Center handles over 380 million domain name decoding requests per day at an average rate of over 4,400 times per second , with a peak value of more than 8,000 times .
Confronted with the rapid development trend of the Internet , the China Internet Network Information Center , which manages domain name registration in China , conducted a reevaluation of the four original state domain name top-level nodes this year and made rearrangements for the " CN " domain name top-level nodes according to the evaluation results .
The center decided to situate the state domain name top-level node in Shanghai , based on the local Internet development level and the qualifications of the accessing unit .
According to sources , at present , there are 45,000 " CN " domain names in Shanghai , an Internet user popularity rate of 26.6 percent . Its Internet popularity rate and usage level are both the highest in the country .
Regions in Eastern China neighboring Shanghai have 130,000 " CN " domain names and 230,000 websites . Their development levels are also among the highest of the country .
As a result , Shanghai was chosen as the first node in the rearrangement plan .
China Becomes World 's Largest Hard Alloy Production Country
Xinhua News Agency , Nanchang , December 22 ( Reporters Yang Yuanyuan , Li Xingwen ) - China 's hard alloy industry has developed rapidly in recent years . Its annual output is more than one third of the world 's total hard alloy output . From the production scale and output standpoint , China has become the world 's largest hard alloy production country , with a whole array of alloy varieties and the ability to produce most of the products .
The information above was gathered by the reporters on the 22nd , at the China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Symposium that is in progress .
Hard alloy is known as " industrial tooth . " It is used as cutting tools , high-pressure tools , and machineries for mining and road construction because of its extremely high hardness and wear-proof capability . The development of the hard alloy industry plays an important role in the entire growth of the tungsten industry .
According to information , China 's alloy industry started in the 1950s of the 20th century , from the ground up . Through continuous development , it has made outstanding achievements so far .
In the early 1980s of the 20th century , when the world annual hard alloy output was at 25,000 tons , the annual hard alloy output of China was approximately 5,000 tons . Entering the 21st century , the world annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China 's output has increased rapidly to 15,000 tons , constituting more than one-third of world 's hard alloy production .
China 's hard alloy export has also achieved significant improvements .
In 1986 , China 's alloy export volume was only 100 tons ; while in 2003 , the export volume reached 2,500 tons . It is expected that this year 's export volume will be more than 3,000 tons , accounting for one third of the world 's hard alloy market circulation capacity as in its output . The annual net profits of hard alloy have increased from less than U.S. $ 4 million in the past to U.S. $ 70 million nowadays .
Asian Development Bank Awards Loan to Support Shanxi Coal Bed and Coalfield Gas Power Generation
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 23 ( Reporter Jiang Guocheng ) - The reporter gathered information from the Asian Development Bank 's China Office on the 23rd that the bank has recently approved a US $ 117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province , powered by methane produced during mining .
The Coal Bed Gas Development Demonstration Project will utilize the newest technology to increase the output of coal bed gas and coalfield gas to supply the fuel for a soon-to-be constructed 120,000-kilowatt power plant .
According to the project plan , when the project is completed in 2008 , it will supply approximately 90,000 residential , industrial , and commercial users with at least 166 million m3 of coal bed gas per year .
The project will benefit about 410,000 people in the Jincheng area .
The total coal output of Shanxi constitutes about one third of the total national output .
The project is estimated to cost U.S. $ 237 million . The Japan Bank for International Cooperation will provide U.S. $ 20 million , while China Construction Bank will provide U.S. $ 37.86 million .
The Jincheng municipal government and two local mining / industrial groups will provide a total of U.S. $ 61.24 million of capital .
The U.S. Trade and Development Agency also awarded a grant of U.S. $ 500,000 to the project .
Through in-mine drilling from the ground surface , the methane obtained from the mineshaft after it is built is called coal bed gas , while that produced during underground mining is called coalfield gas .
Methane is a highly explosive gas and has to be released in advance during the mining process in order to guarantee the safety of the work environment .
The elimination , collection , and utilization of methane will lower the release of greenhouse gas and is useful in slowing down global warming and climate change .
The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide .
The substitution of coal with methane will increase the consumption of clean fuel , improve coalmine efficiency , and make the air cleaner .
Hassing , Senior Officer of the Asian Development Bank stated that the project will hopefully provide approximately 4.5 million tons of emissions reductions of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas .
( International ) Israel Museum 's Most Precious Exhibit Counterfeit
Xinhua News Agency , Jerusalem , December 24 - James Snyder , Director of the Israel Museum , stated on the 24th that the museum 's most precious exhibit , the Ivory Pomegranate , was confirmed as a fake a few days ago .
The Ivory Pomegranate was once believed to be the only artifact discovered from the First Temple , during King Solomon 's era .
Snyder stated in a declaration that the Israeli authorities had conducted a detailed examination on the thumb-sized Ivory Pomegranate .
Experts discovered that the relic should belong to the Bronze Age and is considerably older than the First Jewish Temple 's era .
A line inscribed in Hebrew lettering on the Ivory Pomegranate reads , " Belonging to the Temple of the Lord ( Yahweh ) , holy to the priests . "
The inscription was verified to be added afterwards .
The Israel Museum spent U.S. $ 550,000 to buy this Ivory Pomegranate from an anonymous collector in the 1980s of last century .
Archaeologists and antiquity experts once believed that it was a treasure mounted on the top of a priest 's scepter in the First Temple , and the only relic left from that time .
Snyder claimed that before they bought the Ivory Pomegranate , Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and other experts had authenticated the relic .
According to Haaretz Daily , Avigad only used a magnifying glass to do a cursory check on the relic at that time .
Avigad personally denied such allegations .
In recent months , Israeli police have discovered three major antiquity forgery cases successively and have subpoenaed several hundred people .
During their investigation , the police and the Antiquities Authority discovered serendipitously that the Ivory Pomegranate is a forgery .
The police will file charges against some of the people involved in the case next week .
In the 10th century B.C. , the Jewish King Solomon built the First Temple at present-day Temple Mount to store holy items including the Ark of the Covenant and Noah 's Ark , which were later destroyed .
Shenzhen Enforces " Middle-Water " Usage in Buildings and Small Districts
Xinhua News Agency , Guangzhou , December 26 - Shenzhen will enforce " middle- water " usage in some larger-scale buildings and small districts as a major measure in establishing " water-saving style " cities . At present , relevant specifications and regulations for the middle-water plan are being drawn up .
Middle-water mainly refers to non-drinking water from treated city and daily wastewater that has reached a certain water quality , and can be reused in certain areas .
Its water quality is between tap water and wastewater that goes down the drainage .
In general , it is widely used for flushing toilets , watering gardens and farmlands , cleaning roads , washing cars , and supplementing the water in city fountains and cooling facilities .
A study by Shenzhen Water Works showed that in the mid 1990s of the 20th century , more than 70 buildings in Shenzhen were equipped with the " middle-water " -recycling system . However , the cost of recycling for " middle-water " was too high due to technological , design , and management factors , thus forcing the construction unit to stop using it .
Only RMB 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of extra investment will be needed to install the " middle-water " -treatment system in order for these pipelines to perform their functions properly .
If the more than 70 existing sets of " middle-water " pipelines are being used , according to the present daily usage of 500 tons of " middle-water " in small districts , it will save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen per day .
According to information , the Shenzhen " middle-water " -recycling project will start with the remodeling of the more than 70 existing buildings that have the " middle-water " -recycling system . After summarizing the experience , the project will be further expanded .
Meanwhile , Shenzhen Water Works will draw up specifications for the " middle-water " -plan with urban planning and development departments as soon as possible and will enforce " middle-water " usage in some larger-scale buildings .
The treated " middle-water " will first be used in watering the trees in and around the city .

( International ) Auctioned Yukos Assets Won 't Be Included in Gazprom
Xinhua News Agency , Moscow , December 30 ( Reporter Song Shiyi ) - Medvedev , Head of the Russian Presidential Administration Office and Chairman of Gazprom , told the press on the 30th that Gazprom will merge with Rosneft in January as planned . However , the assets of Yuganskneftegaz , the largest subsidiary of Yukos purchased by Rosneft , will not be included in the assets of Gazprom .
Moreover , according to reports , when discussing the reason why the assets of the auctioned Yuganskneftegaz will not be included in Gazprom 's , Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko stated that it is mainly because the state is already the major shareholder of Gazprom and the state does not want to increase its stake above the controlling-shares limit .
He said that Yuganskneftegaz 's assets will be removed independently and transferred to an entirely state-owned company .
On the 19th of this month , the Russian Federal Property Foundation held a public auction on 76.79 percent of Yuganskneftegaz 's shares , the largest subsidiary of Yukos . The newly established Baikal Financial Group won the bid with U.S. $ 9.35 billion .
On the 22nd , the state-owned Gazprom announced that it had bought the shares of Baikal Finance Group , the company that won the bid of Yuganskneftegaz 's shares , thus becoming its new owner .
Analysts believed that the main reason for Russian authorities to use trickery in the auction of Yukos ' assets was that they want to take the leading position in related legal disputes .
This September , Russian President Putin had approved Gazprom 's acquisition of Rosneft .
Gazprom was established in February 1993 . It is the world 's largest natural gas tapping company .
The natural gas reserves held by this company account for 65 percent of that of Russia .
Last year , the natural gas tapping volume of the company constituted 93 percent of that of Russia and 20 percent of the world .

In an interview with our reporter , an official from the Chennai Fish Workers Federation said that even when the fishing boats are repaired , the fishermen will be afraid to go out to sea for a few months because they personally witnessed the sea 's wanton destruction and cruelty .
Some of them lost their families , some suffered financial damages . Their psychological fear will remain for a long time .
According to estimations , the output of the state fishery will decrease in 2005 by 30 percent from 2004 .
Most of the coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu state were destroyed during the 26th tsunami . The state thus became the hardest-hit disaster area in India .

Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , January 11 ( Reporter Suxiao ) - The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong stated on the 11th that this year 's global economic outlook is still optimistic . The Hong Kong economy is expected to have an approximate 6 percent increase this year , with a 4.4 percent growth on an annual basis in the first quarter .
Richard Wong , the Director of the APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong , stated in the " Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast " press conference that even though the interest rate is expected to rise this year , the economic growth of Hong Kong 's major economic partners will be weak , and the respective 3.6 percent and 8.5 percent growth in the U.S. and Mainland Chinese economies , the global economic environment in 2005 is still optimistic .
He stated that the center predicts an approximate 6 percent growth in the Hong Kong economy in 2005 , while the consumer prices at year-end will rise by 3 percent .
The adjustment of the labor market is still slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to roughly 6.3 percent at year-end .

Alan Siu , the Executive Director of the center said that the momentum of the economic growth in the first quarter will slow down and the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) will have a 4.4 percent increase . The slowdown reflects a weakening external demand for Hong Kong due to an even slower economic growth of Hong Kong 's major trading partners .
According to the report , the real GDP growth of Hong Kong in 2004 will record a strong 8 percent increase and the average consumer price level slightly drops by 0.5 percent , while deflation disappeared in the third quarter of last year .
Chow Yei-Ching , the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast of the Hong Kong University , stated that the robust growth of the Hong Kong economy in 2004 mainly reflects the sound fundamentals of the local economy . The foreign trade market is competitive and is able to capitalize on the strong global economic growth and the economic growth in the Mainland last year . The ending of deflation also enables businesses to have more cash flow .
