Bahraini Princess Married US Soldier , Sensational Marriage Breaks up in Five Years
Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa 's marriage with the humble US marine Johnson was once a widely hailed story by US television channels . However , their thorny marriage has now ended in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after lasting for just five years .
The fairy-tale marriage between Meriam , a member of the Gulf state of Bahrain 's royal family , and US marine Johnson , who devoted himself to this banned love affair , risking his military career , became the subject of a television movie .
But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that merely five years had passed before the couple confronted each other in court when Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town where procedures for marriages are quick and for dissolutions are quicker .
The two met in 1999 when Johnson was a career army man stationed in Bahrain .
But his life changed dramatically when he met the young teenage princess and the pair fell in love .
The young couple 's union was forbidden by the royal family , so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , taking her out of her home country to the US .
After a bitter immigration lawsuit against US authorities , the couple married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip famed for its magnificence when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19 .
But Johnson said the wealth of temptations in the " sin city " of Las Vegas , ongoing tensions with Meriam 's wealthy and powerful family , and rumors of a plot to assassinate him had finally contributed to the breakup of the thorny marriage .
Johnson said he made a living parking cars for hotel and casino guests , while Meriam increasingly indulged in the nightlife of the gambling town , frequenting night clubs late at night and ignoring him as her husband .
Meriam abandoned her husband a year ago .
" She has sunk to the bottom , " Johnson said .
Eurozone Indicators This Week will Suggest Weak European Economy to Continue
Economists said Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week would show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while British data was expected to show increased industrial activity .
They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries would continue to indicate great volatility each month , but the long-term trend of economic output would suggest slowing economic growth .
The most crucial figure of the week will be from Germany , where the ZEW institute 's economic expectations indicator , which is closely monitored by the market , is due on the 7th and will provide the first evidence of economic confidence in Europe for December .
The ZEW index slumped to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month .
The euro 's significant appreciation would continue to weigh on economic confidence in the recent surveys , so there 's no reason to expect the indicator to rebound , economists said .
" Considering that the main factors driving down economic confidence , including the euro 's appreciation , uncertainty in the global economy , and a worsening unemployment rate in the German job market have been a drag on future growth expectations during the December survey , a strong rebound in the index is unlikely , " economists at BNP said .
According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News , the AFP financial news services , the indicator will slip again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month .
But Teather of the UBS investment bank said Germany 's ZEW economic expectations indicator could even drop to zero in December .
" Future expectations of German economic activity , as reflected in the ZEW survey among analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall in our view , " Teather said .
East-West Tension over Ukraine Crisis to be Discussed by the OSCE
Repeated accusations by Russia of Western intervention in Eastern European affairs have increasingly been a focus because of the political crisis in Ukraine , and the issue is set to dominate the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation opening in Europe tomorrow .
Russia has been unhappy for a long time with the gradual extension of Western influence into corners of Europe that Russia previously considered its backyard , such as the Baltic states , Georgia , and central Asia , and so recent events in Ukraine could be an important topic at the two-day OSCE meeting in the Bulgarian capital Sofia .
The Ukrainian Supreme Court made its dramatic decision , ordering another poll of the second-round runoff for the recent presidential election . Even before that , the European Union had called on OSCE member states to get ready for its observers to " act with the greatest speed and efficiency . "
A European source said the number of observers sent by the OSCE could increase from the original 600 to 1000 in Ukraine 's new runoff vote , scheduled for December 26 .
US Secretary of State Powell will attend the OSCE annual meeting , which will be perhaps his last foreign visit before stepping down .
The meeting will also be attended by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov , French Foreign Minister Barnier , British Foreign Minister Straw , and their German counterpart Fischer .
The OSCE consists of 55 member states from North America , Europe , and Asia and will mark its 30th anniversary next year .
The organization , established at a meeting in Helsinki , contributed to ending the Cold War .
Bush 's Major Test : Intelligence Reform Bill Faces Congress Vote This Week
The intelligence reform bill that the US Congress will try its best to pass this week is an ambitious plan by Republican President Bush to promote his second term , while his support rate among the Republican lawmakers will be his first major test after reelection .
In a newspaper interview yesterday , Kean , the former Republican governor of New Jersey responsible for an investigation into the September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York and Washington in the US , said the problem with the intelligence reform bill was that it had to go through Congress , and the process alone bode ill for future bipartisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .
" If the president and Congress can 't properly solve these big issues , Congress will become dysfunctional and we 'll be all in trouble , " Kean said .
" We 'll then have to wait for a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the Republican and Democratic leadership in both Houses and a support rate of 80 percent in public opinion polls , " he told the New York Daily News .
A number of lawmakers said yesterday that a failure of the landmark reform bill could delay the overhaul of America 's obsolete spy network operations by months or years , or even end the network altogether .
" If the bill fails to pass this week , it 'll be aborted , " Harman , top Democratic representative in the House Intelligence Committee , said on CNN yesterday .
Congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 before adjourning till early next year .
If it fails , the entire bill will become invalid and will have to wait until 2005 for Congress to rewrite it .
Ukrainian Opposition Firmly Rejects Constitutional Amendment that Significantly Weakens Presidential Powers
Ukraine 's pro-West opposition today insisted it would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by the outgoing President Kuchma ahead of a repeat of the second-round presidential runoff .
The constitutional reform would strip a major part of the president 's existing powers .
After the Supreme Court annulled the November 21 election citing widespread malpractices in the second-round vote and the General Election Commission ordered a repeat of the runoff on December 26 , the opposition leader Yushchenko is again locked in a standoff with Kuchma .
" If the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . This would be unacceptable , " said Yushchenko 's ally Timoshenko .
" We want the president to be able to appoint the chief of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor-general so we can fight corruption and eliminate the group that controls Ukraine 's political and business circles , " she told reporters .
Kuchma , who maintains close ties with Russia , had pushed for the constitutional amendment before the repeat of the runoff due to his concern that the opposition could win the presidential election .
Opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote on the government-proposed constitutional amendment , which caused the parliament to adjourn for ten days .
According to the constitutional amendment , the power to appoint all top posts except for the prime minister , defense minister , and foreign minister will be transferred from the president to parliament , where pro-government forces currently have a near majority .
Based on what the amendment says , the president 's nominees for the prime minister , defense minister and foreign minister need to be approved by the parliament , which may also name its own candidates .
Ukraine 's Political Crisis Enters Third Week , Opposition Calls for Continued Struggle
Ukraine heads into a third week of turmoil caused by the presidential election , amid which opposition leader Yushchenko today called on supporters to keep up the street struggle by besieging the presidential palace and government buildings until outgoing president Kuchma sacks Prime Minister Yanukovich and his cabinet members and takes steps to ensure the new upcoming presidential run-off is fair .
Thousands of Yushchenko 's supporters have massed in the capital Kiev for two weeks , besieging government buildings and camping in the main avenue specially designed by Soviet experts for viewing military parades . The power of people Yushchenko 's supporters demonstrated forced the Supreme Court to annul the November 21 second-round presidential election and the General Election Commission to order a repeat of the runoff on December 26 . While parliament has already voted to sack Yanukovich , Kuchma has not signed a decree to replace the successor whom he 's been grooming .
Yushchenko tonight told supporters who gathered at Independence Square in the capital city that Kuchma should replace his administration and reshuffle the General Election Commission , and that both parliament and Kuchma should agree to revise the election law to prevent vote rigging .
He said in a speech serving as the prelude to the December 26 runoff that " until these decisions are made , there can be no talk of lifting the blockade of the government buildings or the presidential palace .
For 14 days this square has demonstrated a love of Ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of Ukrainians who are capable of defending their choice . "
" We are experiencing a struggle between good and evil forces . The entire world is applauding our victory and the entire world is proud of Ukraine , " he said .
As the opposition steps up pressure on the Moscow-backed ruling authority and Yushchenko is again locked in a standoff with Kuchma over the constitutional reforms , Polish President Kwasniewski , Lithuanian President Adamkus , and Russian envoy Gryzlov are expected to arrive in Kiev on the 6th for a fresh round of mediation .
Egypt Announces Breakthrough in Middle East Peace Difficulties
Egypt said a new framework was expected for the Middle East peace deal .
It also said it could soon return an ambassador to Israel to restore full diplomatic ties after a four-year break .
Quoting " high-level " Egyptian sources , Egypt 's state-owned news agency MENA said parties seeking a peace plan have gradually reached common understanding on the comprehensive reconciliation .
" An important understanding has been reached among Egypt , Israel , Palestine and significant international groups , such as the United States and the European Union , agreeing in principle to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a comprehensive way , " MENA said .
Following the death last month of Palestinian strong man Arafat , the international community has resumed advancement of Middle East peace policies aiming to end years of bloody conflicts between Israel and Palestine as soon as possible .
MENA said officials expected that " preparations would last until July , after which political action will begin . "
Then a conference would be held in Washington by parties concerned with the Middle East peace process , namely Israel and Palestine , as well as Egypt , the United States , Russia , and several European countries , MENA said .
Expected topics include " bilateral ceasefire ; " the Palestinian Authority would " put a stop to anti-Israeli attacks and strengthen its control in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank . "
In this regard , MENA said , Israeli Prime Minister Sharon promised " to halt Israeli military operations against the Palestinians as long as the Palestinian Authority respects the ceasefire accord and keeps its land under control . "
Over One Billion Children Around the World Tortured by War , Poverty , and AIDS
More than one billion children , half of the world 's population of children , suffer from the scourge of poverty , war and rampant AIDS , said an annual report released today by the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) .
The rights of children to a healthy and secure growing environment , as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child , are often jeopardized , due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms , UNICEF said .
" When half of the world 's children are growing up in a hungry and unhealthy environment , when schools become targets of attacks and whole villages are destroyed by AIDS , we can no longer deliver on our promise to children , " UNICEF executive director Ms. Bellamy said while releasing the annual report in London .
" Too many governments are making deliberate decisions that actually hurt children , " Bellamy said .
Statistics compiled through the joint efforts of researchers from UNICEF , Britain 's London School of Economics and Bristol University have revealed a terrible scenario of children at risk in much of the world .
Researchers found that some 640 million children around the world lack adequate shelter , 400 million children have no access to safe drinking water , 270 million children have no access to health care services , and 140 million children ( mostly girls ) have never been to school .
More seriously , at last 700 million children suffer from various forms of " severe deprivation , " which includes lacking access to information and not being able to use public sanitary facilities , researchers said .
The 10th annual report released by UNICEF today said war and AIDS had destroyed networks that normally protected children , and children had at times become direct victims of war and AIDS .
China Pushes for Lifting Arms Ban , but EU Resists
The European Union today rebuffed pressure from China 's Premier Wen Jiabao for a quick end to the arms embargo on China , but said it would work towards lifting the 15-year-old embargo .
The EU 's rotating president , the Netherlands , made the above comments after a China-EU summit .
The Netherlands said there was no need to speculate on how the EU would end the embargo .
The EU imposed the arms embargo on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
Though the issue of the arms embargo has shadowed the China-EU summit , the two parties signed several trade and other agreements during the meeting .
Both China and the EU hailed the agreements as having strengthened the " strategic partnership " between them .
" The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " said the EU , in a joint statement released after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao .
The statement said that the Chinese delegation " welcomed the positive message and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU " .
Wen Jiabao did not hide his displeasure at a press conference after the summit , saying the embargo " fails to reflect the partnership between China and the EU " .
" The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation or the partnership between China and the EU , " Wen Jiabao said .
Some EU countries led by France are pushing for a lifting of the embargo , saying the ban is outdated .
Without amending or strengthening related EU laws , some farsighted people in the EU worry that lifting the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales , which could boost China 's military forces .
" I explained that the EU is willing to lift the embargo but I also noted that lifting the ban is interrelated with adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports , " said Dutch Prime Minister Balkenende .
Preliminary Study Finding : Folic Acid May Lead to Breast Cancer , but No Conclusion Made
A latest heath study reported that " folic acid , " a vitamin B widely taken by pregnant women to prevent fetal malformation , may increase the risk of breast cancer .
But the researchers said their results could merely be the result of chance , as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer , so they urged pregnant women to continue taking the supplement .
Folic acid is found naturally in dark , leafy vegetables and is known to the medical community as a crucial aid in the growth of the fetus .
Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen in Britain followed 3,000 women who took either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo in the 1960s when they were pregnant , mostly during the second and third phases of their pregnancy .
By September 2002 , breast cancer rates among those women who took the five-milligram folic acid were twice as high as those who took the placebo alone , said the report published in a British medical magazine .
Ness , one of the researchers , stressed the results were merely " preliminary ... aimed at pointing out the way for further research . "
" It is entirely possible that this is a result of chance , so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is any , before we reach any conclusions , " he said .
Ness said women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements .
He said the current dosage recommendation " is far from the experimental dosage . "
According to British health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant or in the first phase of their pregnancy should take 0.4 microgram folic acid daily , which is more than 10 times smaller than the doses taken by those women in the study described above .
Ukraine 's Presidential Vote Rerun with Two Candidates in Totally Different Moods
The two rivals , who will face off in Ukraine 's presidential rematch vote on the 26th of this month , are now prepared for a final duel .
Yushchenko , the pro-West opposition leader is confident of winning the election , while Yanukovich , the pro-Moscow sitting prime minister said he was no longer in the election representing the " shameful " ruling party .
Meanwhile Russian President Putin made an about turn on Ukraine 's bid to join the European Union , saying he would be pleased to see Ukraine 's entry into the EU .
When asked about the percentage of vote he expected to get in the rematch , Yushchenko told a press conference packed with reporters : " Modestly speaking , I should be able to get some 60 percent . "
On the other hand , a visibly fidgety Yanukovich evaded answering reporters ' questions several times and finally uttered only one sentence : " By God 's wish we will win . "
Yanukovich , whom the incumbent President Kuchma had originally groomed as his successor , now changed tack and positioned himself as a candidate fighting both the opposition and the ruling party .
" I used to trust those cowards and traitors who worked under the government , and now I feel disappointed ... the government is really shameful , " he said , nearly mentioning particular names .
As a quid pro quo between Kuchma and the opposition party , some of the presidential powers will be transferred to parliament by amending laws , in order to end two weeks of mass opposition resistance and political turmoil following the November 21 presidential runoff .
The victory of the original winner Yanukovich was annulled by the Supreme Court , which ruled that the poll was beset by negligence and must be rerun .
Powell Visits Hague , Making Final Effort for European-US Harmony During his Tenure
US Secretary of State Powell held talks with top EU officials today , making a final push in his tenure for unity between the United States and Europe .
Powell 's European tour is aimed at mending the diplomatic damage between the two parties caused by the war in Iraq , and the Hague is the last leg .
Powell , on perhaps the last official overseas visit in his tenure , won an EU commitment that the EU would step toward easing the tension before a February visit to Europe by US President Bush .
However , the differences between the two sides still persist .
" We have to intensify bilateral dialogue and rediscover common ground in the second term of President Bush , " said Dutch Foreign Minister Bot , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU .
EU external relations commissioner Ms. Waldner said she believed Europe and the US had already made progress on " putting the difficult moments of the Iraq crisis behind them , " but she also acknowledged that now was a " key moment in the European-US relationship . "
Bush will fly to Brussels on February 22 to meet with EU and NATO leaders .
Powell said the purpose of Bush 's visit would be mending the split caused by Iraq .
Powell visited Sofia and Brussels earlier in his European tour , but achieved only limited progress in the attempt to improve relations .
Especially in Brussels , Powell criticized six anti-war NATO countries , saying their refusal to participate in the Iraqi training missions had harmed the " credibility and cohesion " of the alliance .
But Powell maintained that his meetings had demonstrated the US commitment to restoring full diplomatic ties .
Basescu Elected as Romanian President , Faces the Challenge of Forming Government
Romanian opposition candidate Basescu today won the heated presidential campaign , but the center-right Bucharest mayor may face tremendous challenges in forming the new government due to a fragmented multipartisan parliament .
According to the final official results released today by the Central Electoral Committee , the Justice and Truth Alliance candidate Basescu garnered 51.23 percent of the vote , while his rival , Prime Minister Nastase , got 48.77 percent .
Nastase conceded defeat and offered his congratulations to Basescu .
Outgoing President Iliescu also congratulated Basescu .
Nastase said his Social Democratic Party would assist Basescu with Romania 's smooth entry into the European Union .
The Social Democratic Party won the parliamentary elections held on the 28th last month .
Basescu told a press conference , " Today my top priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing negotiations for Romania to join the EU , " and Romania must try to meet the requirements for joining the EU .
He stressed that the Romanian people should know the costs of this integration , and that the whole nation should unite to ensure there were no voices questioning the integration of Romania .
Romania has completed its EU membership talks and is expected to join the EU in January 2007 .
Also included in Basescu 's administrative priorities are fighting against poverty , eliminating corruption , and ensuring judiciary independence .
Storm over Past Works not Calmed , Oliver Stone Seeks Peace with Turkey
Movie director Oliver Stone , in Istanbul promoting his new film " Alexander , " took the chance today to try to make friends again with Turkey .
His screenplay for the classic " Midnight Express " was criticized as tarnishing the image of Turkey .
" I never thought the screenplay would be hostile to Turkey ; it was intended to be against injustice everywhere , " he told AFP in an exclusive interview here .
Public opinion in Turkey has condemned Stone since the first showing of the award-winning 1978 film .
The film was adapted from the memoirs of Billy Hayes .
Hayes , a young American , was caught at Istanbul airport when he tried to smuggle Indian hemp out of Turkey . He was sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish jail after a protracted lawsuit .
Critics in Turkey have accused Stone of turning Hayes 's original work into a racist screenplay , in which every Turkish character is depicted as a rascal without exception .
The film is also full of scary prison scenes of rape and torture .
" Maybe it was because I was young at that time and wanted to make the point too eagerly and too strongly , which resulted in some zealousness and some anger , " Stone acknowledged .
But he added : " Hayes did get sodomized in the Turkish jail . He was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for a relatively negligible offense and was treated brutally in prison . So everything was based on the facts .
" Seen from a larger perspective , Turkey is not the only country where the prison system doesn 't work well . The United States has similar problems , " Stone said .
Japan 's Economic Growth May Slow Down Next Year
Japan 's economy may slow down towards 2005 as yen appreciation and a widening gap between the rich and poor could break the harmonious atmosphere it enjoyed in the first half of this year .
Though high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have restored Japan 's confidence this year after a decade of stagnation , analysts count on China to bolster economic growth despite growing political tensions between Japan and China .
The evidence is emerging that Japan 's economy could decline briefly in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decrease and manufacturers adjust inventories to avoid a glut .
Based on the new statistical method recently adopted , Japan 's economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1 percent in the July-September quarter , narrowly evading a technical recession .
Currently , economists remain widely separated on the strength of Japan 's economic rebound .
Researchers from France-based BNP Paribas Bank estimate Japan 's economic growth may hit 2.3 percent in real terms for both the current fiscal year to next March and the next fiscal year .
They call 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the US economy is strongly back on the track of recovery and Japanese consumer spending is making up for the slowdown in exports .
A more pessimistic view is from UFJ Institute economists , who estimate only 1.8 percent growth for the current fiscal year and a growth rate as low as 0.6 percent for the next fiscal year .
They cite " potential risks , " meaning that corporate profits do not lead to an increase in personal incomes .
French Foreign Minister : Middle East Peace Process Tests French-US Relations
Following his meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today , French Foreign Minister Barnier said restoration of the Middle East peace talks would " test " their trans-Atlantic relations .
France called for a quick international seminar to push ahead the Israeli-Palestinian peace process after the death of Palestinian leader Arafat . But there were no sign of an agreement at the end of the meeting between Barnier and Powell .
Barnier flew to Washington from Paris for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his designated successor , National Security Adviser Rice , before heading to Brussels for a European Union summit .
While both Paris and Washington agreed to mend their strained ties after the US invasion of Iraq last year , there were still obvious differences on resolving the Middle East impasse .
" We hope to improve the future ties between France and the US and between Europe and America , " Barnier said after a brief discussion with Powell at the US State Department .
" I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to push ahead the peace process between Palestine and Israel , " he said .
Barnier called earlier this week for an early international seminar on the Middle East to take advantage of what he called a " window of opportunity " that emerged after Arafat 's death last month .
But Powell remained unwilling to make a promise .
He said the two spoke of a British plan to hold a meeting which Palestinians will be attending , but they did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held .
US officials have said their priority was to promote local peace in Israel and Palestine and ensure smooth Palestinian election next month .
The election will produce a leader who can control Islamic militants and revive talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians .
Japanese Foreign Minister Machimura Proposes FTA Talks between Japan and South Korea Next January
Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold talks on signing a free trade agreement ( FTA ) at an early date in January next year .
Jiji Press reported that in a meeting with South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Ban Ki-Moon in Ibusuki City , southern Japan 's Kagoshima Prefecture , Machimura said the two sides should resume talks at an early date as authorities in Tokyo and Seoul both expected to sign an FTA by the end of 2005 .
The talks between Machimura and Ban Ki-Moon followed a summit on the 17th between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun , in which Roh Moo-Hyun urged Tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions on North Korea .
As North Korea abducted more than one Japanese national during the Cold War , Prime Minister Koizumi is under huge pressure from the public to punish North Korea .
The families of abduction victims were outraged after Japanese researchers concluded last week that the remains presented by Pyongyang in a bid to prove the deaths of the hostages were not the remains of those kidnapped .
Apart from the kidnapping issue , Koizumi and Roh Moo-Hyun both agreed that the six-party talks aimed at preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons should resume as soon as possible .
Since the stand-off was provoked in October 2002 by North Korea 's secret nuclear weapons program , three rounds of six-party talks have been held but have achieved no concrete results .
North Korea later boycotted the fourth round of six-party talks originally scheduled for September this year .
The six nations in the six-party talks are South Korea , North Korea , the United States , China , Japan and Russia .
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Still Widely Expected to Win General Election Next February
On the eve of 2005 , Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident of winning a second four-year term , but his reputation is tarnished for his failure to quell a bloody separatist insurgency .
With Thai national elections scheduled for February 6 next year , Thaksin and his political rivals are gearing up for the election campaign . Most analysts believe that despite the fierce violent conflicts in the south and the bird flu , he is still expected to win .
A total of 12 people died in Thailand this year from bird flu , which swept across much of Asia but was particularly severe in Thailand , where the Thai government acknowledged it " made mistakes " in coping with the epidemic .
However , this health issue is unlikely to derail Thaksin 's reelection . Instead , many ask only how clear his sweeping victory will be , and what his victory will mean for the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces .
" The phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at Thaksin , he now enjoys popular support , " Choonhavan , Chairman of the Senate 's Foreign Affairs Committee , told AFP .
" But things will begin to fall apart next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and people close to him ) , the social injustices and violence , " he said .
It was the issues of social injustices and violence that led to the insurgency in the Muslim-majority region in Thailand 's southern end , where sporadic separatist rebellions have persisted since January .
Since January this year Islamic radicals have made Buddhists , government officials and security forces targets in gunfights , as well as bombings and beheadings . So far more than 560 people have been killed , and another 100 are missing .
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Says Arafat Poisoned About a Year Ago
Arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in the Ramallah headquarters , the late Palestinian leader Arafat 's cabinet secretary Abdelrahman disclosed .
" Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago , on September 25 , 2003 , " Abdelrahman told the Al-Hayat newspaper .
" At that time , the president vomited after shaking hands one by one with some 30 supporter representatives .
The president 's health started deteriorating from then on . "
Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11 .
Several top Palestinian officials believed Arafat had been poisoned .
But French doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations .
Two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by Abdelrahman , the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon 's cabinet had just made a decision to " remove " Arafat from his post , although without specifying by what means .
Israel 's threat triggered waves of public support for Arafat , who therefore received several supporter delegations .
" Arafat shook hands with those people who came to express their support for Arafat in Israel 's confinement , " Abdelrahman recalled .
Arafat received two groups on September 25 last year : one was a group of cyclists from around the world advocating peace , and the other was a group of political activists .
" The last time Arafat became ill was on October 12 this year , when he had the same symptoms such as vomiting , poor appetite and all the symptoms similar to a flu , " Abdelrahman said .
Bush Admits Iraqi Forces Need to Intensify Training , Offering Support to Rumsfeld
US President Bush admitted today that Iraqi forces were not yet ready to replace the US troops and warned that the general election slated for January 30 next year would not mark an end to the violent insurgencies in Iraq .
Bush , in a one-hour press conference , also expressed support for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , believing the Pentagon chief was " doing a fine job . "
Bush said that despite occasional sharp discord , he vowed to keep working with Russian President Putin , saying now it 's time to progress towards ending the Middle East conflict .
He also believed that multinational diplomacy was the best way to address the problems of surviving " axis of evil " members Iran and North Korea .
After yesterday 's two successive car bombings in Iraq 's holy Shiite Muslim cities of Najaf and Karbala that killed 66 people and wounded more than 200 , Bush admitted the insurgencies have cost the Iraqi people a price but insisted on holding the general election in January as scheduled .
Bush issued a warning to Americans that Iraq 's elections " are just the beginning of a political process " and warned that " I certainly don 't expect the process to be smooth sailing . "
Bush admitted the training of Iraqi security forces produced mixed results .
" When there are heated clashes sometimes , they ( the Iraqi forces ) flee the battlefield , " he said .
He said such Iraqi forces would never be able to safeguard national security and that was unacceptable .
But he believed the training would be fruitful after the Iraqi forces finish a long period of training by the US military .
White House : Iraqi Insurgents ' Attempt to Disrupt Elections Doomed to Fail
Talking about the attacks by insurgents at noon today on a US military base dining hall in northern Iraq 's big city Mosul , which killed 22 people and left more than 60 wounded , White House spokesman McClellan said terrorist activities by Iraqi insurgents would be increasingly rampant as Iraq 's elections were drawing near , but that these " enemies of freedom " would definitely be eliminated .
Reports from Iraq said officers and soldiers were having lunch when a single huge blast hit the dining hall at a US military base , causing severe casualties .
The Interim Iraqi Government is scheduled to hold its first election on January 30 after the downfall of the Hussein regime .
The United States has sent nearly 20,000 new troops to keep Iraq safe during the elections .
There will be a total of 150,000 American troops in Iraq during the elections .
McClellan said that as the elections drew closer , hardcore insurgents loyal to Hussein would generate more attacks in the attempt to derail the transitional government and return to the past , but that " they 'll be eliminated and they are being eliminated . "
As for the results of a new poll , which showed that 56 percent of Americans considered the war in Iraq " not a worthwhile battle , " 57 percent disapproved of President Bush 's way of handling situations in Iraq , and 52 percent believed Defense Secretary Rumsfeld should step down , McClellan said President Bush would not dance to the tune of the polls .
" Polls are only figures at one time , and we are continuing our job based on the progress being made in Iraq . "
Sad Crowd Attends Funeral Procession of Philippine Political Figure Poe
A throng of movie fans today attended the funeral of Poe , the Philippines ' most famous movie star , held under tight security amid fears of an insurgency .
Poe , who died at 65 , was defeated in the presidential election .
The coffin carrying the deceased Poe was escorted by a crowd of mourners , as it was pulled through the streets of the capital Manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .
Hundreds of riot police were deployed around the Malacanang Palace to prevent Poe 's supporters from launching unrest .
These people accused President Arroyo of rigging the May 10 presidential election .
The military also was on heightened alert as intelligence suggested a possible coup to overthrow Arroyo and replace her with Poe 's widow Rocess .
However , the funeral ended peacefully , with fans shouting Poe 's initials FPJ and waving the presidential campaign posters he had used .
Poe died of a stroke on December 14 .
Crying women and children shed flowers on the coffin as the hearse wound its way towards the cemetery .
The Malacanang Palace , close to the route of the funeral procession , used huge shipping containers as make-shift barriers amid Justice Secretary Gonzales 's warning that some could use the funeral to stir up trouble .
Gonzales said there was a " credible intelligence report " of a plot to use the funeral procession and burial to provoke the masses to turn against the government .
But armed forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Pascual said the coup plot apparently ended in smoke after the military deployed troops to guard key areas .
President Arroyo later went outside the Malacanang Palace to greet the troops and police on guard there .
Armitage Warns Syria about the Need to Cooperate with the US on Iraq and Lebanon
US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage warned Syria today , saying that the development of future relations between Damascus and Washington hinged on Syria 's willingness to cooperate with the US on Iraq and Lebanon .
Armitage kept up the pressure on Syria in an interview with Arab reporters .
The contents of the interview were released earlier by the State Department .
Asked whether he expected relations would remain strained between the US and Syria , Armitage said : " I certainly hope the ties will improve , but it 's up to how ( Syrian President ) Assad and his group behave . "
The second highest ranked figure of the US State Department said Damascus should implement UN Security Council resolution 1559 passed in September this year for an early stop to all its interventions in neighboring Lebanon .
Armitage said Syria 's behavior " is not against the United States , but is in discordance with the entire international community . "
Reporters probed whether the US would raise the issue of Syrian non-compliance when the UN Security Council discusses the continued presence of the UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon in January next year . Armitage 's reply was : " We may very well do that . "
On the issue of Iraq , Armitage admitted that Damascus had indeed taken some actions in line with US expectations , such as stepping up border patrols jointly with Iraq and blocking insurgent funding sources .
But he also said Syria " needs to make more efforts . "
AIT and CCNAA Today Sign Lease on Neihu Site for New Building
The American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) signed a lease with the Coordination Council for North American Affairs today on a site for a new building in Neihu . Director of the AIT 's Taipei Office Douglas Paal said a new building is being designed and he hopes for its early completion so as to conduct business in a safe and modern environment .
Douglas Paal and Chen Chung , secretary-general of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs , signed the 99-year lease on a site for the AIT 's new office building at noon at the Grand Hyatt hotel Taipei .
The witnesses were David Keegan , Deputy Director of the AIT Taipei Office , and Jacqueline Liu , deputy secretary-general of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs ; Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen was also present at the ceremony .
AIT , with offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung , was created under the Taiwan Relations Act to handle non-official ties between the American and Taiwanese peoples .
It was at least over ten years ago when AIT began working with the Coordination Council for North American Affairs and the Taipei City Government to locate a plot of land for the construction of a new AIT office building , said Douglas Paal in his remarks .
He said the current offices on Hsin Yi Road looks quite old and are indeed short of space .
For AIT , relocation to a new office building will be a challenge . AIT can consolidate all of its offices currently scattered throughout Taipei and do business in a safe and modern environment .
He said he hopes the new building , which is under planning and designing , will not only help enhance the beauty of Taipei but also become the pride of Taipei citizens .
Upon completion of the planning and designing , tenders will be invited for the construction contract and construction can begin after the builder is selected . Hopefully construction can start in a few years .
AIT spokeswoman Dana Smith said the whole building is expected to cost about 160 million US dollars , including everything from land rent to design and construction costs ; whether it can be completed by 2008 is up to many factors , but it is hoped work will start as soon as possible .
Several Thousand Followers Throng in Bethlehem for Christmas Eve Mass
Several thousand followers were gathering in Bethlehem , the West Bank , for Christmas Eve mass .
Meanwhile Fatah , the mainstream faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization , looked likely to beat Hamas in yesterday 's Palestinian local elections .
Regarding violence and conflicts , three young Palestinians were killed in gunfights between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in Gaza .
Israeli settlers blocked a main road , protesting mortar attacks on the settlements .
The Palestine Liberation Organization leader Abbas was also permitted on a trip to the West Bank town of Bethlehem , which was the first time in the past four years that Israel had allowed the top Palestinian leader to attend Christmas celebrations .
The late Palestinian leader Arafat was a frequent guest at midnight mass after his return to the Palestinian lands in 1994 , but Arafat had been confined by Israeli troops to his headquarters in Ramallah since early December 2001 .
The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem , Sabbah , left Jerusalem shortly after midday today and began his traditional march to Manger Square in Bethlehem , where several thousand Christian followers and Muslim onlookers have being waiting for a long while .
Sabbah was to address several thousand followers at a midnight mass in the Church of the Nativity .
By midday Manger Square was crowed with followers carrying Santa Claus balloons and coming to and from the Church of the Nativity , where a Christmas tree outside was adorned with various lights and all sorts of decorations .
Israeli authorities have eased travel restrictions as a special measure to make it easier for Christians from the Gaza Strip , the West Bank , and Israel to attend the Christmas Eve mass in Bethlehem .
Putin Says Acquiring Main Asset of Yukos Aimed at Protecting National Interests
Russian President Putin said today that Russia was protecting its national interests by acquiring the main asset of the Russian oil giant Yukos , in what was the first renationalization of the post-Soviet era .
At a year-end press conference in the Kremlin , referring to the acquisition by the Russian State Petroleum Company of Yukos 's subsidiary Yuganskneftegaz , Putin said : " Today Russia is using absolutely legal market mechanisms to protect its national interests .
I think that is completely normal . "
The Russian State Petroleum Company today became the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after buying the BaikalFinansGroup that had won a secret auction for Yuganskneftegaz .
The Russian State Petroleum Company announced surprisingly shortly before midnight yesterday that it had acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown BaikalFinansGroup .
The acquisition secures Kremlin control of Russia 's vital energy sector .
Russian authorities have been attacking the Yukos company and its imprisoned billionaire founder Khodorkovsky for almost 18 months .
The Russian State Petroleum Company is merging with the Russian State Gas Company , and with the inclusion of Yuganskneftegaz , the combined three will account for a fifth of Russia 's oil output and all its natural gas production , making it the largest global energy group .
Putin justified the state 's current acquisition by criticizing the fraudulent 1990s privatizations .
The privatization measures at that time handed the most precious assets of the Russian economy to a handful of well-connected businessmen such as Khodorkovsky .
BaikalFinansGroup earlier won control of Yuganskneftegaz by offering 9.35 billion US dollars .
Yushchenko Claims Victory in Ukrainian Presidential Election
Yushchenko supporters massed once again today in Kiev 's central Independence Square to celebrate their victory , as initial election results gave opposition leader Yushchenko a lead over his rival , the incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovich , in the presidential vote rematch and as Yushchenko himself also claimed victory .
" This is the only clean political victory , " the 50-year-old Yushchenko told a crowd that gathered on the square .
It is an elegant victory , where the people have demonstrated their might . The people stood up to what may be the most cynical regime in eastern Europe . And today the Ukrainian nation , the Ukrainian people , have won , " he said .
" For 14 years we have been independent without having freedom , " he said .
Yushchenko added , " Today a new political era is unfolding in Ukraine .
The era of ( outgoing President ) Kuchma , ( his predecessor ) Kravchuk and ( incumbent Prime Minister ) Yanukovich has been consigned to history . "
Citing tally results from more than half of the precincts , Ukraine 's General Election Commission said today that opposition leader Yushchenko for the moment held a 16 percent lead over his rival , the incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovich , in the historic presidential vote rematch .
Ukraine 's General Election Commission said the pro-Western Yushchenko captured 56.33 percent of the vote , as compared with 39.86 percent for his pro-Russian Yanukovich .
The statistical results were based on ballot-counting from 50.96 percent of polling stations in Ukraine .
There are over 33,000 polling stations throughout Ukraine .
And exit polls released earlier also suggested that Yushchenko enjoyed a lead over Yanukovich of 15 to 20 percent .
Japan 's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Tries Telecommuting to Reduce the Stress of Office Life
Japan 's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications today launched an advanced Internet program , through which it aims to have 20 percent of the Japanese work force " telecommute " from home by 2010 , reducing the stress and family disruption brought about by office life .
Currently , around four million Japanese , or six percent of Japan 's 63.2 million working population , use technology to work away from their offices , said an official with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications .
Starting from January , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will have six employees who don 't need to go to their offices at least one day a week ; instead they may work from home , universities or libraries through high-speed Internet services .
Depending on their feedback , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will then expand this advanced program until 20 percent of its 2,500 employees are able to work from home by 2006 .
The program , which enables employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing , is hoped to " improve the efficiency at work places , " said the official with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications .
He said telecommuting would allow workers to spend more time with their family , allowing bread earners to give more help with household duties .
He added that the program would also help reduce traffic jams , car emissions , and overcrowding in trams during rush hours .
He said the goal of this program is to raise the percentage of Japanese telecommuters to 10 percent by 2005 and to 20 percent by 2010 " by encouraging the sharing of telecommuting expertise with private businesses . "
Pentagon Starts Unprecedented Relief Operation for Asian Tsunami Victims
The Pentagon said today that it had started one of its biggest operations to help victims of the Asian tsunami , mobilizing two carrier battle groups , 20 aircraft including reconnaissance and supply planes , and thousands of personnel .
Pentagon spokesman , Lieutenant Commander Hicks , said the US military faced the challenge of operating simultaneously in several different regions after the tsunami catastrophe on the 26th that claimed the lives of more than 80,000 people .
" It is one of the biggest humanitarian relief operations by the Pentagon , " he told AFP .
Lieutenant General Conway , head of military operations for the Joint Chief of Staff , said they were seeking to evaluate the scale of the tragedy and had sent disaster relief assessment teams to Thailand , Sri Lanka and Indonesia .
The Pentagon said it had sent 20 aircraft to South Asia , including six C-130 transporters carrying water and food , five KC-135 in-flight refueling planes and nine P3 reconnaissance planes .
The Pentagon has also mobilized the aircraft carriers Lincoln and Richard and their accompanying ships .
Conway said the Lincoln battle group , with 12 affiliated helicopters and 9,000 personnel , had left Hong Kong for the Gulf of Siam and would eventually deploy off the coast of Sumatra .
Carrier Richard , carrying 25 helicopters , 2,100 Marines and 1,400 sailors , had set off from Guam and was expected to reach the Bay of Bengal by January 7 next year .
The Pentagon has decided to mobilize another five ships from Guam and two from the Diego Garcia base on the Indian Ocean that can produce fresh water .
The relief operation by the US military would be based at Thailand 's Utapao base on the Gulf of Siam , Conway said .
At Least 169 Killed and 375 Injured in Nightclub Blaze in Argentine Capital
At least 169 people had been killed and 375 injured in the flames at a Buenos Aires nightclub on the 30th , said an official today from the city government of Argentine capital Buenos Aires .
When the fire broke out , the nightclub was packed with some 2,000 youngsters celebrating the end of the school year .
Buenos Aires Health Secretary Stein said the casualty toll was not a final figure .
" This is a disaster ! This is a disaster ! " Argentine Interior Minister Fernandez told reporters outside the smoldering nightclub , warning that the death toll was only provisional .
Stern said at least 375 people were injured in the flames , including 18 police officers .
The fire broke out before midnight on the 30th at a downtown discotheque , when some 2,000 youngsters were attending a rock-and-roll concert in the club , Stein said .
Buenos Aires Mayor Ibarra said unconfirmed reports said the blaze started after somebody tossed fireworks during the concert .
" This is a terrible night , " Ibarra told Todo Noticias television channel .
Dead bodies were lined up on the street as firefighters endeavored to put out the fire .
Outside the blazing discotheque was a chaotic scene early today , as several hundred of police and firefighters mingled with stunned youngsters and anxious parents searching frantically for their children .
It Takes Weeks to Deliver Relief Supplies to Aceh Victims : UN
The United Nations said today that it would take " weeks " before vital relief supplies could be delivered to tsunami victims in isolated areas of Indonesia 's Aceh Province .
US navy helicopters today flew into Banda Aceh , the capital of Aceh Province , as an increasing number of field hospitals were operating in the city and relief supplies poured into the airport .
But director of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia , Elmquist , told the correspondent that it was impossible to rapidly deliver the relief supplies due to various coordination and infrastructure problems .
" It will take weeks before we send the relief supplies to all the isolated areas , " Elmquist told the correspondent over the telephone after returning to capital Jakarta from Banda Aceh .
" It 's a worrying problem and we are leaving no stones unturned to establish a distribution system for Banda Aceh , " he said .
The UN and other relief organizations have warned residents in Indonesia 's Sumatra disaster area may die within days if they fail to immediately get clean water , staple food , and medical treatment .
Asked if the delayed delivery was nothing else than a death sentence for some tsunami victims , Elmquist replied : " I hope not . I hope that people manage to get food and water , but obviously it 's not a situation we are pleased to see . "
He said : " It 's a very serious situation and we can only hope there 's possibility to expedite the operations . "
Japan Offers 500 million US dollars for Disaster Relief , the Largest Amount Among of All Countries
Japan today pledged 500 million US dollars in support of countries hit by the massive Indian Ocean tsunamis . As countries race to give a hand to victims of the world 's worst disaster , the donation from Japan has ranked it No.1 among all countries and increased to 1.6 billion US dollars the total amount so far pledged internationally for relief and reconstruction .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said in a statement that Japan , as Asia 's largest economy , would consider more assistance , including money and expertise .
He said : " Japan will do its best to provide assistance in three aspects : financial resources , knowledge and expertise , and human resources . "
" For the time being , Japan will give affected countries and related international organizations 500 million dollars of cash donation as emergency assistance to handle the disaster , " he said .
Koizumi also said he would attend a meeting of world leaders on the 6th in the Indonesian capital Jakarta to discuss aid for the countries hit by tsunami .
The United States yesterday increased its assistance ten-fold to 350 million US dollars after US President Bush was criticized for being slow to respond to the massive human disaster .
China , which is seen as increasingly having an intention to challenge Japan 's influence in Asia , also pledged 60.5 million US dollars , a large sum for a developing country .
Koizumi said : " Japan will make more contributions by mobilizing helicopters and the personnel of the fire department . "
" Japan will also consider , as soon as possible , additional efforts , including utilizing Japan Self-Defense Forces aircraft , ships and personnel . "
Japan had previously promised 30 million US dollars in support of tsunami-hit countries .
A foreign ministry spokesperson said the 30 million US dollars was included in the 500 million mentioned by Koizumi .
50 Groups to Provide Medical Assistance to Indonesia 's Aceh : WHO
50 aid groups had arrived in Indonesia 's Aceh Province to provide medical assistance to survivors of the tsunami , the World Health Organization said today .
The WHO 's Indonesian representative Petersen said the WHO was trying to coordinate all the groups and held a meeting with them this afternoon .
Petersen said coordination was very difficult because many groups had gone directly into Aceh for disaster relief .
" We are trying to sort it out , each of the group has just come , but every group has expressed a great willingness to cooperate , " Petersen said from Jakarta in a telephone interview .
Petersen reiterated the WHO 's main concern was to prevent outbreaks of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea , which could kill thousands of people .
Petersen said : " We are very worried because we have a lot of people homeless who don 't have sufficient clean water or adequate food .
So everything is ready for epidemic outbreaks . "
However Petersen stressed there had been no signs of such problems from diseases so far .
Indonesia 's Health Ministry said the number of people killed in Sumatra in the tsunami may hit 100,000 , with most of the victims in Aceh Province .
As most medical facilities were destroyed in Aceh Province , the Indonesian military and the governments of Singapore and Australia have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week , and the United Nations Children 's Fund has begun delivering basic medical kits to aid 200,000 children .
Powell Predicts Shiite Victory in Iraqi General Election
US Secretary of State Powell predicted today that Shiites would win in the upcoming Iraqi elections , but downplayed the concern for increased Iranian influence in Iraq in case of a Shiite victory citing past discordance between Iranian and Iraqi Shiites .
There are growing indications that Sunni Muslims may either boycott the January 30 elections or be banned from the elections by relevant Iraqi authorities for spreading insurgency .
On American NBC 's " Meet the Press " show , Powell said : " The new government coming into power , the transitional national assembly , will be majority Shiite .
The majority of the Iraqi population is also Shiite . "
Shiite Muslims make up over 60 percent of the Iraqi population , with most of them living in the southern and central parts of the country .
Sunnis live in central and western provinces , accounting for about 20 percent of the population .
Former Iraqi foreign minister Pachachi , who now heads the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Independent Democrats Party , called today for postponing the elections , but Powell said the Iraqi elections would go on as scheduled .
Powell also said he felt it was impossible that Shiite control of Iraq 's future government would mean political situations in Iraq would be dominated by Iran .
" I now believe that even though there may be Iranian influence -- and Iran will certainly try to influence political situations in Iraq , there is significant difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between Iranian and Iraqi Shiites , " he said .
As Waves of International Aid Pour in , Time Increasingly Unfavorable to Tsunami Victims
Foreign aid troops are dropping food and setting up clean water supply systems in areas hit by the Asian tsunami to help millions of homeless and starving survivors .
Statistics show the death toll has climbed to just below 150,000 .
Relief supplies poured in from world governments , while US President Bush entrusted his father Senior Bush and former president Clinton with the task of raising private donations .
A delegation headed by US Secretary of State Powell arrived in Thailand late yesterday ahead of a crisis summit on the 6th in the Indonesian capital Jakarta to show US concern and assess the progress of relief efforts .
Powell 's entourage included President Bush 's younger brother , Florida Governor Jeb Bush , and US Agency for International Development Administrator Natsios .
Powell was to head the delegation to inspect the devastation in Thailand , Indonesia , and Sri Lanka before attending the summit on the 6th .
Powell said that he had headed a delegation here to assess the devastation " and see what else the US might need to do , " but wouldn 't immediately pledge any more aid besides the 350 million US dollars already promised .
Now days after the catastrophe , there has been talk of giving up the search for thousands of tourists still missing , many of them foreign tourists .
However , Thai Prime Minister Thaksin vowed the search would go on in his country .
" Foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests . We will continue to try our best to search and will not stop , " Thaksin told reporters on Phuket island .
An unprecedented international relief effort is going on .
Navy helicopters dispatched from the US aircraft carrier Lincoln are performing the tasks of dropping aid and picking up survivors for a second day in Indonesia 's Aceh Province .
Rear Admiral Crowder , Commander of carrier Lincoln , said 50,000 sterling pounds of food and water had been delivered to disaster-hit areas and the mission was " going well . "
Political Maneuvering Hidden Under Righteous Acts of Aid for Asian Tsunami Catastrophe
As aid floods into areas hit by Asia 's tsunami disaster , something less noble is also secretly underway : governments are wrangling over who should give , who should receive and who should dominate in the largest relief effort in modern times .
The catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled old battle flames , including the discordance between the United States , United Nations , and Europe and the struggle to be the leader in Asia .
But relief experts still hold cautious hope . Considering that the tsunami has hit so many countries , the global nature of the catastrophe might lead to another precedent : governments pledging aid will really make good on their promises .
" There has never been a time where governments follow through their promises 100 percent and on time , " said Juma , a professor of international development at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government .
With donations from governments already as high as two billion US dollars , major players in international politics including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell , as well as leaders of Australia , China , and Japan will hold a crisis summit rich with political overtones on the 6th in Jakarta .
US President Bush has raised US assistance nearly ten-fold to 350 million US dollars after being accused of a slow response and UN relief chief Egeland openly lambasted rich nations for being " stingy . "
In Asia , the tsunami catastrophe fueled hidden wrestling for regional influence as an increasingly confident China promised 60.5 million US dollars in aid , a large sum for a developing nation .
Japan , which has been cutting down on its foreign aid budget for six consecutive years , acted quickly to smash any allegation that its national strength was declining by pledging to donate at least 500 million US dollars , a sum that dwarfed all other countries .
World Leaders Descending on Sri Lanka to Inspect Devastation
World leaders including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell were arriving in Sri Lanka to view in person devastation from the massive tsunami that claimed the lives of 30,600 people in Sri Lanka the end of last month , Sri Lankan officials said .
They said Powell had already arrived and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan would arrive shortly after noon .
Powell was to visit some of the areas worst hit by the tsunamis on December 26 last year , including Galle Region in the south where US Marines were based for relief operations , the US Embassy said in a press release .
Lee Hae-Chan would tour the west coastline accompanied by the Sri Lankan prime minister , the South Korean Embassy said .
" Accompanied by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Rajapakse , the South Korean prime minister will tour the western coast to view firsthand the resulting loss of lives , livelihoods and property , " the statement said .
Lee Hae-Chan would stop over in the worst-hit Hambantota to oversee relief operations being carried out by the South Korean private sector and non-governmental organizations .
UN Secretary General Annan is due to arrive in the evening to begin a two-day visit .
" He will visit some of the affected regions in the south and the east , accompanied by World Bank President Wolfhensohn , " said UN spokesman Samarsinghe .
World Health Organization Director General Lee Jong-Wook will also arrive in Colombo today .
German Foreign Minister Fischer is due to arrive in Sri Lanka on the weekend .
Sri Lankan officials say many other leaders are expected to come over the next few weeks .
These leaders include Canadian Prime Minister Martin , whose trip to Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month was announced in Canada yesterday .
US to Boost Peace Efforts After Palestinian Elections : Bush
US President Bush said today that he was " deeply heartened " by the strong turnout in today 's Palestinian elections , and he also vowed that the US would boost its peace efforts .
President Bush said in a statement : " Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip took a key step towards building future democratic politics by electing a new president of the Palestinian Authority .
Observers of the general election have described it as free and fair . "
" This is a historic day for the Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East , " he said .
Exit polls showed former prime minister Abbas had won the election by a huge margin with two-thirds of the votes .
He would succeed Arafat as president of the Palestinian Authority .
" These efforts , including today 's presidential election and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months , are essential for the establishment of a sovereign , independent , democratic , and peaceful Palestinian state , and the new state will ensure a secure Israel , " Bush said .
He said the US government looked forward to working with the newly-elected president of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people to advance the cause of Middle East peace .
Peace in the Middle East is consistent with the wishes of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples , which is to coexist peacefully and with safe .
Bush further urged Israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
He added the Arab states must " take concrete steps with all interested parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , lend financial support to the Palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists . "
Annan 's Plan to Visit Rebel-Held Area in Sri Lanka Was Blocked
UN Secretary General Annan said today that he wanted to return to Sri Lanka one day to " see every part of the country . "
Annan has just ended a two-day visit in tsunami-hit areas of Sri Lanka , but reports said the Sri Lankan government blocked him from visiting northern areas held by the rebels .
When asked in a press conference whether the Sri Lankan government had blocked him from traveling to zones held by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , as reported in several Sri Lankan newspapers , Annan said : " I 'm hoping to come back and visit all parts of the country and help accelerate the peace process . "
Annan said President Kumaratunga had personally objected to an on-site visit in guerrilla-held areas out of her fear that the rebels would use his visit as political bargaining chips .
He said : " I raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the efforts for the peace process .
I 've also discussed that with President Kumaratunga . "
Annan 's inability to visit rebel-held areas has irritated residents of rebel-held city of Jaffna in the north , where several hundred people protested in front of a UN office in Jaffna .
However , the Sri Lankan government firmly denied the media reports , saying the media were " misreporting " the matter .
On another front , as all parties dedicated themselves to the relief efforts , the Sri Lankan meteorological agency warned about possible typhoon strikes on Sri Lanka 's coastline , saying a typhoon was currently being formed offshore .
Russian Space Agency Denies Rocket Fuel Causes Illness Among Children
The British weekly science journal Nature reported that highly toxic rocket fuel , spurted from Russia 's space ship launches at the Baikonur space base in Kazakhstan , has caused serious diseases among children in the vicinity . Russian Space Agency today denied such suggestion .
The Nature science journal published today quoted a study , saying that levels of endocrine and blood diseases among residents in polluted areas are twice as high as in normal regions .
The study was conducted by epidemiologist Zykov , who led a group of Russian scientists .
" It 's not confirmed that space-related activities have a direct influence on the health of residents , " the Russian Space Agency responded .
The study quoted by Nature science magazine focused on children in the Altai Republic .
The Altai Republic is located in a mountainous region on the fringes of Siberia .
The Altai Republic was chosen as the study subject because of pollution from unburnt fuel , especially hydrazine .
Some of Russia 's space launching missions use hydrazine as the fuel during the early stages of take-off .
Zykov compared the health records of some 1,000 children in two polluted areas for the years 1998-2000 with 3,300 health records of a nearby unpolluted control group .
He concluded that the percentage of children needing medical care in the worst-polluted areas was twice as high as that of the unpolluted control group , and that the duration of treatment was also twice as long , the Nature science journal reported .
White House Says Iraqi Elections will Certainly have Flaws
The White House acknowledged today that Iraqi elections slated for January 30 are " not going to be perfect " ; meanwhile two more car bombs exploded today in Iraq 's Mosul , killing at least two Iraqi soldiers .
Asked if he agreed with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi 's words that violence would make voting impossible in some areas of Iraq , White House spokesman McClellan said : " We all acknowledge that the election is not going to be perfect . "
" This is the first time Iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders . It 's the election for a transitional government , and it 's one of three elections this year , " he said .
" So we 're going to do everything possible to help the Iraqi people and the interim government ensure as many people as possible participate in this upcoming election , " McClellan said .
Allawi acknowledged that some parts of Iraq would not be able to take part in this month 's election , as bloody insurgency on the 11th killed at least 25 people , six of whom died in a car bombing in former president Hussein 's hometown of Tikrit .
Meanwhile , two more car bombs exploded in Iraq 's Mosul today , leaving at least two Iraqi soldiers dead .
US army Sergeant Schaeffer told AFP that a van exploded in the attempt to attack a joint convoy of US and Iraqi military vehicles , killing an unknown number of civilians .
Another car parked on the opposite side of the street exploded and killed two Iraqi soldiers , Schaeffer said .
US Trade Deficit in November Tops 60 Billion US Dollars , Setting Fresh Records
According to data released by the US Commerce Department today , US exports shrank 2.3 percent in November last year , sending the trade deficit to an all-time high of 60.3 billion US dollars .
While exports fell to a five-month low of 95.6 billion US dollars , imports rose 1.3 percent to a record 155.8 billion as orders for imported oil increased by 1.3 percent , or more than 2 billion dollars , to a record 14.2 billion .
The trade gap increased 7.7 percent from October 's revised 56 billion dollars and soared sharply by 50.8 percent from 40 billion for November of the previous year .
Wall Street economists had expected the trade deficit for goods and services to shrink to about 53.3 billion US dollars , according to a survey conducted by CBS MarketWatch .
Although the weakening dollar has made US-made products cheaper both at home and abroad , the US trade deficit continues to widen .
Today 's report from the Commerce Department will put more pressure on the greenback and renew calls for Washington to act on energy independence and the trade imbalance with China .
The decline in US exports for November last year was the result of a 1.4-billion-dollar slump in capital goods , including a drop of 325 million US dollars in aircraft and aircraft engines .
Exports of industrial materials , most are energy related , fell by 800 million US dollars .
Exports of autos , consumer goods and food also dropped .
Japan 's Defense Agency Chief : Remember Militarist Past , Respect Dignity of Neighboring Countries
Japan 's Defense Agency Chief Yoshinori Ono said today that Japan would not forget its militarist past and would keep in mind the " dignity " of Asian neighbors as it took a higher profile internationally .
" While we get along with Southeast Asian nations , we should never forget the past , " Ono said when asked about possible unease over Japan 's dispatch of troops to tsunami-hit areas in South Asia .
He told reporters : " We must build a relationship with friendly nations , which allows us to tell them we have good intentions .
We should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while we are looking at the past . "
Ono particularly noted that this year marked the 60th anniversary of the end of Second World War and said : " We want to be reborn and cooperate for the sake of a new era . "
Ono , who has just wound up his visit to several tsunamis-hit counties in South Asia , said he felt the " dignity " of an independent country when Indonesian leaders told him that Japanese troops should finish their relief mission by the end of March at the latest .
The United Nations has voiced concern over the deadline the Indonesian government has imposed on foreign troops .
Foreign troops are widely praised for reaching some of the remotest tsunami survivors .
Nearly 1,000 members of Japan 's Self-Defense Forces are heading to countries ravaged by the December 26 tsunamis that have so far killed more than 163,000 people .
This is the biggest deployment of Japan 's Self-Defense Forces since the end of the Second World War .
Japan 's US-dominated postwar constitution stipulated that the self-defense forces must not use force .
Political Intervention in NHK Program ? Debate Erupts in Japanese Media
Allegations that pressures from politicians forced the public-run Japan Broadcasting Corporation ( NHK ) to shorten a program aired a few years ago on Japan 's slavery of comfort women during World War II have left liberal Japanese media at odds with their conservative counterparts .
Liberal Japanese media have assailed NHK for slashing large portions of interviews it had conducted , mostly with critics of Japan 's wartime conduct and victims of enslaved comfort women , allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders .
But conservative newspapers have justified NHK 's decision to edit the show , believing the company 's senior management has a duty to ensure its programs are fair and objective .
The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on the crime of the Japanese military of enslaving comfort women during wartime .
The trial , held by a women 's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000 , found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women by Japanese military during Japan 's occupation of Asian nations .
Historians say at least 200,000 young women , mostly from Korea but also from Taiwan , China , the Philippines , and Indonesia , were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese military brothels during wartime .
The program 's producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th , disclosing that before the program was aired , senior NHK officials met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party , Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa , both of whom had expressed concerns over the content of the program .
Nagai said top NHK officials then edited and shortened the program .
" NHK bowed to political pressure , " he said .
Abe and Nakagawa admitted meeting with NHK officials and telling them to be " fair " but firmly denied pressuring the company .
Eurozone Data Show Core Inflation Under Control
Economists said today that eurozone economic data to be released this week would show core inflation remained under control .
Meanwhile , eurozone industrial output and French consumer spending are both expected to fall .
The European Union 's statistics office Eurostat is expected to confirm that inflation edged up to 2.3 percent in December from 2.2 percent in November when it releases inflation data on the 20th of this month .
But the increase largely reflects the rise in tobacco tax , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .
Core inflation figures are to be released with consumer prices figures .
Economists noted core inflation , which excludes food , energy , tobacco and alcohol prices , has remained in a 1.6 to 2.0 percent range for the past two years .
European Central Bank president Trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have dwindled recently .
While inflation will remain above two percent in the coming months , it is likely to drop by the end of this year .
Meanwhile , another economist said the eurozone November industrial output due on the 18th is expected to fall , given growth slowdown in Germany .
German industrial output declined 1.7 percent in November , and a survey among economists conducted by AFP financial news services shows eurozone output would slip another 0.4 percent in November after a 0.5 percent fall in October .
Eurozone industrial output is expected to rebound in December , said Schmieding of Bank of America .
Bureaucracy Adds to the Woes of Tsunami Survivors
Three weeks after the worst tsunami in history , survivors are struggling with vices such as bureaucracy and politicking , while the world 's attention has turned elsewhere .
Thousands of rotten corpses dug out of the debris drove the death toll from the December 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 168,000 , while the upcoming Iraqi elections and President Bush 's inauguration gala have replaced the tsunami as the headlines in global media .
Indonesia had initially asked foreign troops involved in humanitarian missions to leave the country within three months , but later took back the demand .
In Thailand , leaders of Canada , Sweden , Norway and Finland were gathering for a discussion over a reconstruction plan and efforts to identify the dead .
But survivors are faced with new difficulties , such as inveterate bureaucracy in Indonesia , which hinders the distribution of aid pouring in from across the world .
" We are like persons who do not exist . We have suffered great losses in the tsunami , losing everything and are starving , " said Busriadi , a fisherman in a small village near the capital of Aceh Province , Banda Aceh , on Indonesia 's Sumatra Island .
He said : " Where are the food , the clothes and other relief supplies we see on television flooding into Aceh ?
Busriadi , like thousands of disaster-battered survivors , lost his identity cards and other official documents due to the tsunami , which makes his efforts to gain aid a nightmare .
Although he begs government officials for help and shuttle everyday from one place to another to go through all sorts of formalities , the results are always the same : he is not able to get relief supplies .
Zeng Qinghong Reportedly Visited Zhao Ziyang Before His Death
Chinese Vice President Zeng Qinghong visited Zhao Ziyang , the deposed former general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party , in the hospital just before he died this morning , the Hong Kong-based China Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said .
The Information Center said that according to Zhao Ziyang 's family , Zeng Qinghong visited Zhao Ziyang at the Beijing Hospital at 6 : 00 am this morning , about an hour before he died at the age of 85 .
Zhao Ziyang once served as the general secretary of the CCP and premier . He was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the use of force to suppress the democratic movement in Tiananmen Square . He had been under house arrest and deemed persona non grata by the government ever since .
The Information Center said that according to Zao 's family , the sitting Premier Wen Jiabao , who once worked as Zhao Ziyang 's subordinate , did not visit him when he was critically ill .
But retired Central Committee member and his one-time aide Tian Jiyun visited him before Zhao Ziyang slipped into a coma on the 14th .
The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy has maintained contact with Zao 's family and has for years issued timely and correct information on Zhao Ziyang 's situation .
The Information Center said some 20 retired top party , government and military leaders were preparing an open letter to the CCP , calling for a reappraisal of Zhao Ziyang 's contributions and demanding a public funeral for him .
The center also said that Zhao Ziyang 's family would not be allowed to hold or organize the funeral and the party would make the final decision on arrangements .
Zhao Ziyang 's wife , Liang Boqi , is 86 years old .
The center added she had not been told of her husband 's death as of this early evening due to her poor health .
Zhao Ziyang Passed Away , China Urged to Promote Democratization
Zhao Ziyang , a former leader of the Chinese Communist Party , was highly commended worldwide after he died of illness today . Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , the Taiwanese government , and overseas Chinese democracy activists all coincided in appeals to Beijing to carry out Zhao Ziyang 's vision of democratic reforms .
Zhao was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the democratic movement at Tiananmen Square . He was put under house arrest for the rest of his life and died this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85 .
" I hope they ( China ) are committed to democratization , " Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said while mourning for Zhao Ziyang , according to reports by Jiji Press .
Taiwan also urged China to carry out democratic and political reforms after Zhao 's death .
Overseas Chinese democracy activists regarded Zhao Ziyang as " one of China 's greatest reformers , " who sacrificed his political life to oppose the bloody suppression of the democratic movement at Tiananmen Square .
Lian Shengde , president of New York-based Free China Movement and once a student movement leader , said : " During his 15-year house arrest , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards the rule of law and democracy .
Zhao Ziyang will be remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a person of principle . "
Democratic activists have requested China hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and give fair appraisal for his achievements .
But they acknowledged Zhao Ziyang was unlikely to receive such courtesy because the Chinese government feared that the masses , dissatisfied with the rule of the communist party , would take this opportunity to start an insurgency .
The 1989 student movement was prompted by the death of Pro-reform leader Hu Yangbao .
Xinhua News Agency released a brief report today , saying that Comrade Zhao Ziyang died in Beijing due to illness , which is the only official comment on the matter .
Wealthy Nations not Fulfilling Promise to Slash Poverty-Stricken Population : UN
Wealthy nations are not making good on their promise to provide financial aid aimed at halving the world 's population in extreme poverty by 2015 , a UN-appointed panel of experts said in a new report .
Rich nations around the world have committed themselves to the UN 's ambitious " millennium development goals " program to improve the fate of the world 's poor and suffering .
But with more than one billion people worldwide living on less than a dollar a day and 2.7 billion people surviving on less than two dollars , the UN experts said time is running short for wealthy nations to fulfill their promises .
" With the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achievable , " said Brown , head of the UN Development Program .
The UN experts said the world 's 22 richest nations had promised to give 0.7 percent of their GDP to aid the developing nations , but they were only delivering 0.25 percent .
UN Secretary General Annan commissioned development experts , led by former Harvard economist Sachs , to write the report on the progress of the goals , which include wiping out extreme poverty , making primary education universal , cutting the child mortality rate , and fighting AIDS and other deadly diseases .
The report said : " The practical solutions exist . The political framework is established . And for the first time , the cost is affordable . All that is needed now is action . "
UN Announces Establishing Global Disaster Warning System
The United Nations announced it would set up a global disaster warning system to guard against fierce natural disasters .
But after South Asia 's massive tsunami tragedy , differences remained on which country 's technology to use .
UN agencies said in a joint statement released after a global conference in Kobe , Japan that UN experts would establish a disaster warning system to reduce damage by fierce natural disasters .
Serious devastations caused by South Asia 's massive tsunami have outraged Indian Ocean nations .
Briceno , director of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction organization said : " The new program will bring peace and security to human beings .
An effective early warning system would safeguard the lives and security of millions of people around the world .
But in large part , the UN 's announcement is only symbolic .
An official at UNESCO said more key discussions were needed regarding the disaster warning system .
UNESCO is spearheading the establishment of a global disaster warning system .
" Right now we have different programs proposed by several countries , so we need to do coordination work , " said Bernal , director of UNESCO 's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission .
Bernal said the commission would hold two meetings within 60 days , in the hope of deciding which country 's tsunami warning system they would pick .
One of the meetings would be in Paris , and the other was yet to be determined .
Bernal hoped a decision could be made in July so the system could be completed and in operation by mid-2006 , the target date set by UNESCO .
Beijing 's HIV Cases Rise 40 Percent Annually
BEIJING , December 1 , Xinhua ( Zhao Xinpei , Li Xu ) A few days ago Beijing 's Municipal Health Bureau released the latest figures of HIV cases in Beijing : the cumulative number of HIV-infected people found and reported ( in Beijing ) was 2046 from 1985 to October 2004 , with an average yearly growth of 40.6 percent .

HIV infections among the floating population are mainly through intravenous drug use and blood collecting and supplying , while HIV infections among foreign nationals are mainly through sexual transmission .
In order to curb further spread of AIDS , beginning in July 2004 , disease control centers of 18 districts and counties in Beijing established free consulting clinics and antibody screening labs to conduct face-to-face consultations , primary blood screening , and epidemiological research , which will be expanded step by step to Class II hospitals and above across the city .
Beijing 's Municipal Health Bureau has designated the hospitals of You 'an and Ditan as free HIV / AIDS treatment providers responsible for the clinical part of free treatment of HIV / AIDS , and the required medicines and agents are purchased through the cooperation of Beijing 's Municipal Health Bureau and Municipal Finance Bureau .
Beijing 's Municipal Education Commission developed policies that give free education to the children of HIV carriers and AIDS patients and school enrollment polices for HIV carriers among young students .
Currently , Class II and above hospitals across the city with a department of obstetrics and gynecology are responsible for free HIV / AIDS consulting and screening , while the hospitals of Ditan and You 'an are providers of antiviral medication to pregnant women .
So far , 1390 condom vending machines have been installed in some districts , methadone maintenance treatment is carried out for drug abusers , and clean needle exchange pilot stations have been set up .
Shanghai Becomes World 's No.1 Power Generating Equipment Producer in Output and Capacity
SHANGHAI , December 1 , Xinhua ( Reporter Jiang Wei ) With the completion of the trial-run of a 660-megawatt generator unit , Shanghai Turbine Generator Co , . Ltd , a subsidiary of the Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group , reached the annual production target of 15,000-megawatt units on the 1st , ahead of schedule . This makes Shanghai the world 's No.1 producer of power plant equipment in both output and capacity , realizing the long-time dream of several generations of workers in China 's equipment manufacturing industry .
The Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group is the largest power plant equipment manufacturing base in China .
In recent years , with the rapid growth of demand for power generating equipment in China , generator manufacturers across the country have entered a period of high growth and great development .
The Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group has integrated its advantageous resources in power generating equipment such as steam turbines and power plant boilers . After taking orders of four units of million-kilowatt thermal generators , it received production orders for nine heavy gas generator units and three waste-heat boilers by way of a lump sum tender .
At the same time , through integrated operations , it further improved the efficiency of enterprise management , technical development and production .
At present , the Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group represents 40 percent of China 's power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas market in the Middle East , Southeast Asia and South America .
This year alone , as a producer of components for the mainframes of power generating equipment , the Shanghai Turbine Company received sales orders valued at 6 billion Yuan .
The " electricity shortage " this summer has significantly driven up the demand for power plant equipment across the nation , and competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is increasingly hot , said Zheng Jianhua , President of the Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group .
The group is implementing the three grand targets of " researching and developing million-kilowatt thermal , gas turbine generator units and million-kilowatt nuclear power " so as to realize the goal of being listed in the Global 500 at an early date .
( Hong Kong , Macau , Taiwan ) Hong Kong Observatory Provides New Services to World Meteorological Organization Websites
HONG KONG , December 2 ( Xinhua ) Hong Kong 's Observatory launches two new services , starting today , for the " World Weather Information Service " and the " Severe Weather Information Center " websites maintained by the World Meteorological Organization .
A spokesman at the observatory said the two new services were : adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the " World Weather Information Service " website , and adding a recap function of the tropical cyclone tracks for the past seven days to the " Severe Weather Information Center " website .
These two new services come right after Hong Kong 's Observatory began to provide official observation data on global heavy rain ( including snow ) for the " Severe Weather Information Center " early this year .
It was mentioned that the " World Weather Information Service " website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatic data for major world cities .
The new service provides , for the first time , global official weather observation , with the global distribution graphs of cloudiness and rain as its first service .
The new web page features a wide coverage and high density and is updated regularly , up to eight times a day .
The new product on the " Severe Weather Information Center " website is a recap function for tropical cyclone tracking .
In the previous design , the website would no longer store information , such as the location , of a tropical cyclone once it had dissipated .
However , there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about a tropical cyclone several days after it has landed .
Therefore , the new product stores information on the intensity , location and track of tropical cyclones for the past seven days , allowing the public and the media to retrieve needed information after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated .
World 's First Rapid Diagnostic Kit for H5N1 Bird Flu Virus Successfully Developed in Shantou
SHANTOU , December 3 , Xinhua ( Zhang Yiwen and Lin Junqiang ) The reporters learned from the Shantou University 's Medical College / University of Hong Kong 's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center that they have developed the world 's first rapid diagnostic kit for H5N1 bird flu virus , after half a year of cooperation with Xiamen 's University .
Using this rapid assay to test specimens from suspected cases , the diagnosis of bird flu infection can be made in as short as less than an hour .
Based on existing information , bird flu , which is listed as a highly toxic killer virus , has a mortality rate far higher than that of the SARS virus , said Professor Guan Yi , director of the Shantou University 's Medical College / University of Hong Kong 's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center .
Previously it would take between 3 to 5 days , and sometimes more than a week to confirm " suspected " viruses .
The successfully introduced rapid test for bird flu viruses uses the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the gold-labeling assay to test specimens such as excreta , nasal pharyngeal secretions , chick embryo-cultured intact virus or split virus , as well as serum . The diagnosis of bird flu virus infection may be reached in one to two hours .
The new techniques are easy , convenient and rapid , and allow for detection in the outbreak site . With an accuracy of more than 90 percent , they help with early detection , early diagnosis , early isolation and early treatment of the infectious virus , avoiding wide epidemic and severe plague .
Commissioned by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Shantou University 's Medical College / University of Hong Kong 's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center recently hosted a training workshop on bird flu virus assay techniques for trainees from 20 provincial and municipal centers for disease prevention and control across the country , on which the latest rapid assay techniques for bird flu virus were demonstrated .
Spokesman for Foreign Ministry Commissioner 's Office in HK Expresses Strong Dissatisfaction with Speech of US House International Relations Committee Chairman Hyde
HONG KONG , December 3 ( Xinhua ) A spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong issued a statement on the 3rd , expressing strong dissatisfaction with a speech delivered a few days ago in Hong Kong by US House International Relations Committee Chairman , Rep. Hyde .
The spokesman said that the speech delivered on the 2nd in Hong Kong by Mr. Hyde , chairman of the US House International Relations Committee , viciously attacked China 's development and progress , and smeared China 's foreign policy with cold-war mentality ; " we are strongly dissatisfied with it " .
The spokesman said it is widely known that China 's development is not only in the fundamental interest of 1.3 billion Chinese people , but also contributes to the world 's prosperity and development .
China is a responsible country in the international political arena and has played a positive and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability .
Regarding nuclear non-proliferation , China has all along strictly complied with relevant international conventions , firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in all forms , and advocated settlement of such issues through negotiations , talks and by strengthening international monitoring .
The spokesman noted that Mr. Hyde , unfortunately , ignored these facts and made those extremely irresponsible comments at a moment when the Sino-US relations are heading towards soundness and stability . This is completely against the common understanding reached recently between the Chinese and US leaders on bilateral ties , it contradics the mainstream voices in American society advocating the strengthening of cooperative relations with China , and will undoubtedly do harm to the development of Sino-US relations .
China 's Biggest Sea Water Desalinization Project Settles in Zhoushan
HANGZHOU , December 6 , Xinhua ( Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun ) The biggest ever sea water desalinization project in mainland China , with a daily treatment volume of up to 10,000 tons , will settle in the Putuo District of Zhoushan City , in the province of Zhejiang .
For residents of Zhoushan , who have long suffered from water shortages , the vast sea water besides them will soon become clear and sweet tap water streaming into thousands of households .
The reporters learned from relevant authorities that the State Oceanic Administration 's Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center and the government of Liuheng Town in Zhoushan 's Putuo District signed a cooperation agreement a few days ago on a ten-thousand-ton sea water desalinization project .
With a 50 million yuan investment and a daily fresh water output of 10,000 tons , the project so far is the biggest sea water desalinization project in mainland China . The first phase of the project is expected to be completed next year .
Zhoushan City is one of the water-starved cities in China .
There are a total of 1,390 islands , large and small , across the city , with an average fresh water availability of 601 cubic meters per person , which is only 25.4 percent of the average level for Zhejiang Province . The water supply problem has long disrupted the lives of residents in the island city .
Liuheng Town in the Putuo District , for example , has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day , and the cost per ton is over 10 yuan .
The reverse osmosis sea water desalinization technology developed by the State Oceanic Administration 's Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center is a pressure-driven film separation process , a hot topic in current international sea water desalinization research .
Responsible personnel from the center said that through technological improvement and equipment localization , the cost and power consumption of the reverse osmosis sea water desalinization project have both been slashed .
The cost of desalinizing one ton of sea water will drop further to the level of 5 yuan .
This forebodes that the cost of sea water desalinization is likely to be close to the prices of tap water and industrial water .
( International ) Hungarian Referendum on the 5th Produces Invalid Results
BUDAPEST , December 5 , Xinhua ( Reporter Liu Weimin ) Hungary held a referendum on the 5th on the questions of privatization of state health care facilities and granting dual citizenship to ethnic Hungarians abroad .

Hungary 's government and ruling party had previously called for voters to vote against the two questions , while the opposition party urged voters to cast yes votes .
It is reported that the voter turnout in the referendum is the lowest in all past referendums and elections .
After the results of the polls were released , Hungarian Prime Minister Gyurcsany delivered a speech admitting the failure of the referendum .
He said the government would take greater initiative to develop ethnical policies and carry out health care reforms .
Mr. Orban , president of Hungary 's largest opposition party Fidesz , said that although the number of people who cast yes votes didn 't reach the threshold , the referendum is beneficial .
He appealed to the government and the parliament to take into account the results of the referendum when making relevant laws .

( International ) ANCOM Presidential Council Holds Special Meeting in Peru
CUSCO ( Peru ) , December 7 , Xinhua ( Reporters Liu Guoqiang and Wang Lu ) A special meeting of the Andean Community ( ANCOM ) Presidential Council opened on the 7th in Peru 's famous tourist city of Cusco .
Presidents or delegates attending the meeting will hold discussions on plans to deepen integration of the Andean region and on the promotion of economic and social development .
In a message delivered at the opening ceremony of the meeting , Peru 's President Toledo said it had been 35 years since the establishment of ANCOM , but major problems such as poverty were still unresolved .
At present the poverty rate in the Andean region is as high as 53 percent , posing a serious threat to the region 's democratic governance .
Therefore , ANCOM member governments should seek to establish effective mechanisms to get rid of poverty and to promote public participation in national affairs , so as to improve social stability and development .
Toledo said that although quite a few issues were yet to be addressed within the ANCOM , great progress had been made towards South American integration , and the establishment of a South American Community of Nations would be announced at the Third South American Summit to be held here on the 8th .
He expressed his belief that the creation of the new regional bloc would play a vital role in promoting the region 's political , economic and social development .
Apart from Toledo , Bolivian President Mesa also attended the meeting .
Colombian President Uribe , Ecuadorian President Gutierrez , and Venezuelan President Chavez were unable to attend the meeting due to different reasons , but they will come to the Third South American Summit to be held here on the 8th .
Established in 1969 , the Andean Community consists of the five countries of Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Venezuela , and Peru . With headquarters in Peru 's capital Lima , it is a regional organization for economic cooperation among Latin American countries .
As the ANCOM 's top decision-making body , the Presidential Council meets once every year .
The previous meeting was held in July of 2003 in Ecuador 's capital Quito .
Construction of Underground Power Plant to Begin Soon for Three Gorges Project
WUHAN , December 8 , Xinhua ( Reporter Shi Yongfeng ) Bids were publicly invited for the first time on December 8 for the main part of an underground power plant for the Three Gorges Project , a prelude to the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant .
The Three Gorges Project is designed to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydraulic generator units , with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts . Once the generator units are all in production , the average power generation per year will be 84.7 billion kilowatt hours .
With the aim to further explore the power generating potential of the Three Gorges Project , the Three Gorges Project has reserved spaces in its initial design for building an underground powerhouse as an extension project .
According to officials at the China Three Gorges Project Corporation , the Three Gorges underground power plant is laid out in the mountains on the right bank of the Three Gorges Dam , with major buildings such as the intake tower , diversion tunnel , main plant , tailrace system , busbar shaft and 500kv transformer substation .
The underground power plant will have six 700,000-kilowatt generator units .
This will increase the number of generator units installed in the Three Gorges Project to 32 from 26 designed originally and the installed capacity will soar to 22.4 million kilowatts from 18.2 million kilowatts , which will significantly strengthen the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project .
Flood Prevention is the top priority for building the Three Gorges Project .
Based on the operation schedule of the Three Gorges Reservoir , the water level in the Three Gorges Reservoir will be lowered from the normal pond level of 175m to the flood control level of 145m each year before the flood season .
Therefore , the construction of the underground power plant will increase the water usage rate of the Three Gorges Reservoir , reduce water loss and increase power generation , thus maximizing the time of peak regulation without water loss .
Currently , the earlier phase projects of the Three Gorges underground power plant , such as adit excavation , tailrace canal excavation and timbering , have begun in advance .
It is said that the underground power plant will be fully completed and put into production by the end of 2008 .
Chinese Sailing Festival Ready to Come Out
BEIJING , December 8 , Xinhua ( Reporter Huang Fuhui ) Yao Mingde , head of China 's Road Transport Association , said at a press conference here on the 8th that he was " fully confident " in creating a Chinese Sailing Festival .
Yao Mingde , who also heads the Preparatory Directorate of Activities Commemorating the 600th Anniversary of Zheng He 's Voyages to the West , said all 16 member departments of the Preparatory Directorate including the Ministry of Communication unanimously agreed to designate July 11 of each year , the day Zheng He started his first voyage , as the Chinese Sailing Festival and they will propose the national government to create this festival .
It was mentioned that creating a festival that requires no vacations should be approved by the State Council .
Zheng He is a world-famous navigator .
During the 28 years from 1405 to 1433 , Zheng He led a fleet of 200 ships with nearly 30,000 people on seven long voyages across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and Africa , traveling over 300,000 kilometers and visiting more than 30 countries and regions .
China will organize a series of activities to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He 's voyages to the west .
The logo of the commemorative activities has been released in Beijing on the 8th .
The logo consists of a sailing vessel cutting through the waves to the west , rolling light blue arc-shaped waves , and the words " 600th Anniversary of Zheng He 's Voyages to the West 1405-2005 . "
The designer is Yao Ying , an art teacher of Xi 'an No.1 Middle School in the province of Shaanxi .
People from all walks of life have urged the creation of a Chinese sailing festival to take advantage of the opportunities of the 600th anniversary of Zheng He 's voyages to the west and the promotion of education among the young , so as to improve the people 's awareness of maritime navigation and nautical concepts , to carry forward the spirit of the Chinese nation , and deepen patriotic education .
Yao Mingde said China has a sea area of more than three million square kilometers . 90 percent of cargo in China 's international trade is moved through ocean shipping .
China is a world leader in navigation , it 's not appropriate that there is not a sailing festival within so many other festivals .
Taiwan Province has already designated July 11 as the Sailing Festival .
More than ten countries in the world such as the United States , Canada and Japan have Sailing Festivals .
( International ) Ivorian Sides Agree on Implementing Peace Accord
ABIDJAN , December 8 , Xinhua ( Reporter Liu Shaoping ) The United Nations Operation in Cote d 'Ivoire issued a bulletin in Abidjan late the 8th , stating that UN Secretary General Annan welcomed the agreement reached by Ivorian parties on continuing to implement the peace accord and urged all parties to seize this opportunity and ensure that the peace process makes " genuine progress , " so as to prepare for the general election in October 2005 .
The bulletin said Annan also stressed that different parties in Cote d 'Ivoire should reach consensus on a " detailed program of action . "
He also " placed high expectations " on South African President Mbeki and the African Union 's continued efforts to resolve the crisis in Cote d 'Ivoire , in cooperation with the Economic Community of West African States and the United Nations Operation in Cote d 'Ivoire .
Commissioned by the African Union , Mbeki paid a four-day visit to Cote d 'Ivoire between the 2nd and 6th of this month to seek a plan to resolve the crisis in Cote d 'Ivoire .
At the end of the visit , Mbeki announced that the Ivorian sides had reached an agreement on four proposals .
The proposals include completion of relevant legislation on the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement , starting the disarmament process of warring personnel , the returning of all ministers returning to their posts to exercise their duties , and the restoration of security in Cote d 'Ivoire .
The chairmen of Ivorian parliamentary groups held a meeting a few days ago and decided that the parliament would review the drafts about constitutional reform starting on the 10th .
The Ivorian opposition militia also announced on the 8th that leaders of the opposition militia would hold a meeting soon for an overall assessment of the peace process and to discuss the issue of disarmament .
A coup took place in Cote d 'Ivoire in September 2002 , followed by a civil war .
The leading party and the opposition militia of Cote d 'Ivoire reached agreements in France and Ghana , in January last year and July this year respectively , agreeing to restore peace and realize ethnic reconciliation .
But the process of implementing the agreements hit a lot of snags , which have repeatedly thwarted the peace process .
The Ivorian peace process was once again at an impasse when the opposition militia , who held the northern region of Cote d 'Iviore , called back their representatives in the government in mid October .
The situation in Cote d 'Ivoire further deteriorated after serious conflicts erupted in early November between the Ivorian government troops and French troops in Cote d 'Ivoire .

Guangxi Commemorates 75th Anniversary of Bose Uprising
NANNING , December 11 , Xinhua ( Reporter Wang Mian ) Bose , a traditional revolutionary base area with a population of 3.6 million , marked the 75th anniversary of the Bose Uprising on December 11 through a series of activities .
On December 11 , 1929 , Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi , together with other leaders , led and launched the famous Bose Uprising , which created the Youjiang Revolutionary Base and the Seventh Army of the Chinese Workers ' and Peasants ' Red Army .
The Bose Uprising is another successful armed uprising led independently by the Communist Party of China after the Nanchang Uprising , the Qiushou Uprising and the Guangzhou Uprising .
On the morning of December 11 , over 2,000 people gathered at the Bose Uprising Monument with flowers in their hands . They presented flowers and bowed ... in memory of the brilliant exploits of the martyrs .
After that , they watched the film " Bose Uprising " and attended events such as a picture exhibition named after Zhang Yunyi in Guangxi .
" Though we been taught a lot of things regarding patriotic and collectivistic education in our regular history and politics classes , when we actually come here to have a field visit today , we feel this is a live patriotic education lesson , " said Huang Qunsheng , a student from Bose Senior High School .
The Bose traditional revolutionary base area has been continuously improving this patriotic education base since early this year during the activities celebrating Deng Xiaoping 's 100th Birthday , by renovating the Bose Uprising Memorial Park , building a forest of steles depicting Deng Xiaoping 's handwriting , and rehabilitating the Yuedong guild hall , which is the original home to the Seventh Army of the Chinese Workers ' and Peasants ' Red Army .

Experts Proposes Setting up a Spokesperson System for Minors in China
SHANGHAI , December 13 , Xinhua ( Reporter Liu Dan ) " China 's Youth Social Education Forum -- 2004 Media and Minor Development " that closed in Shanghai on the 13th proposed that China should set up a spokesperson system about the conditions of minors , which regularly releases news about their development status and problems .
A survey conducted by a relevant organization in Shanghai showed that minors read extra curriculum books for an average of 1.17 hours per day per person , watch TV for 1.05 hours , and browse the Internet for 0.99 hours , meaning that in the extra curriculum schedule of minors , about half the time is spent with the media . And the media is becoming a factor not negligible in minors ' growth and development as a brand new social force .
" The media is a window linking the minds of the young to the outside world . Once the window opens , fresh air will flow in together with flies and mosquitoes , "
said Chen Tianqiao , chairman of Shanghai 's Shanda Networking Development Co . , Ltd .
While the media is creating good conditions for minors to grow up soundly , the need for market competition and economic interests , plus the low quality of some media staff , has made opinions in some articles misleading for the thinking and values of teenagers , and some media even spread violent and pornographic content .
Currently there are over 2,000 television channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies in China broadcasting 1,868 radio programs , and the number of net surfers within the country is as high as 87 million .
Organizers of the forum said that the creation of a spokesman system for minors could provide authoritative survey data on the status and problems of adolescent development and change the current status of " disorderly voices " from the media , so as to offer a sound and favorable public opinion environment for the raising of minors .
( International ) Iraqi Foreign Minister Said Iraqi Elections Face Three Major Problems
DUBAI ( United Arab Emirates ) , December 14 , Xinhua ( Reporter Xing Xudong and Yan Yi ) Zebari , foreign minister of the Interim Iraqi Government , said on the 14th in Dubai that Iraqi elections due on January 30 next year would face three major problems : worsened security situation that would hinder and disrupt the election process , turnout affected as voters dare not cast ballots out of fear for terrorist attacks , and ensuring the transparency and fairness of the elections to the greatest extent .
In a speech delivered at the " Arab Strategy Forum " in Dubai , Zebari said it 's very important that Iraq holds the elections as scheduled , because the elections not only decide Iraq 's new leader , but also define Iraq as a free , democratic and united country belonging to all Iraqis .
He expressed his belief that the future Iraqi government will be a legitimate administration representing the Iraqi people and expressing their wishes .
Zebari said the US-led coalition is in Iraq to protect the country at the request of Iraq , since the current Interim Iraqi Government cannot control the security situation and lacks the ability to wipe out terrorists and saboteurs .
The existence of the coalition has a time limit . According to UN resolutions , this will end after Iraq has completed its political process and a legitimate government has emerged .
Zebari stressed that new Iraq will maintain its Arab and Islamic nature and comply with the Charter of the League of Arab States .
The Iraqi people face the historic opportunity of rebuilding the nation on a new basis . Iraq will rise again and become an important member that makes contributions to its own ethnic group within the Arab family .

( International ) United Nations Warns More Death from Drug Abuse Expected Globally in 2005
VIENNA , December 17 , Xinhua ( Reporter Song Guocheng ) Costa , Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased heroin yield in Afghanistan , heroin is expected to trade at a stable price in black markets in 2005 and with higher purity , causing more deaths among drug users .
Costa has sent warnings to officials at health and drug prevention organizations in Europe and surrounding countries , urging those countries to closely follow the latest trends of drug cultivation in Afghanistan and international drug crime , and take appropriate precautions .
According to statistics from the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime , in 2001 , when opium cultivation was banned in Afghanistan , heroin yield in Afghanistan declined by 94 percent , and the purity level of heroin in European black markets dropped 50 percent a year later .
Deaths from drug abuse in Europe fell by 20 percent from 2000 to 2002 .
Costa said Afghanistan 's opium cultivation area this year increased by 64 percent compared to 2003 , and heroin yield topped 500 tons , which is more than the volume of global black market heroin trade for the whole year , a trend meaning higher purity on a global scale and commensurate increase in the number of deaths attributed to drug abuse .
Costa believed drug sources in Afghanistan have posed " clear and present threats " to global drug prevention efforts , and a greater supply of heroin in black markets means " death sentences " to drug users .
It is estimated the number of deaths worldwide from overdoses is approximately 100,000 a year .
( International ) US Military Identifies a Second Guantanamo Prisoner Who is not Enemy Combatant
WASHINGTON , December 20 , Xinhua ( Reporters Pan Yunzhao and Tan Xinmu ) Gordon England , Navy Secretary of the US Defense Department said at a Pentagon press conference on the 20th that a military review panel had confirmed a prisoner held at the US naval base in Guantanamo was not an enemy combatant and would be released soon .
This is the second Guantanamo prisoner the US military has ruled out as an enemy combatant .
England said the Pentagon confirmed the prisoner 's identity a few days ago , and the State Department would inform the prisoner 's country of this decision and make arrangements for his release .
But he didn 't disclose the prisoner 's name or nationality , and the circumstances under which he was captured .
England refused to admit that the Defense Department had made a mistake in determining the identity of the Guantanamo prisoner .
He said the military review panel responsible for reviewing the identity of Guantanamo prisoners reviewed 507 prisoners , confirming the identity of 230 , of whom 228 were correctly classified as enemy combatants .
The United States has released some 200 Guantanamo prisoners so far ; some were freed after repatriation to their home counties and a few others are still in jail after their return , but at least 12 have taken part in activities against the US troops after being released .
Around 550 " Al-Qaeda " and Taliban suspects are currently being held at the US naval base in Guantanamo , most captured during the US-Afghan war .
The US government calls these people enemy combatants instead of prisoners of war , and so they are not protected by the Geneva Convention .
Many countries have criticized the US government for detaining their citizens indefinitely , as well as some international organizations that condemned these acts of the US as violating international law .
Top-Level Node for Country Code Domains Settles in Shanghai
SHANGHAI , December 21 , Xinhua ( Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu ) China 's Internet Network Information Center and Shanghai 's Information Industry ( Group ) Co . , Ltd signed a contract on the 21st on the entry into Shanghai of a top-level node for country code domains .
Domain names , which are now widely used as Internet addresses , are the communication basis for carrying out all Internet applications such as e-business and e-government .
When visiting websites or accessing email , people have to first enter domain names . Through the resolution service of a domain name system , domain names are converted to IP addresses , and website hosts are then found , enabling information transfer .
A domain name system is like the " nerve system " that controls information transfer on the Internet .
China has more than 90 million Internet users as of now , which is the second largest number worldwide , and the number of websites has topped 650,000 , said Mao Wei , director of China 's Internet Network Information Center , the administrator of China 's country code top-level domain name system .
The volume of domain name resolution is proportional to Internet users , and with the fast development of the Internet , the volume of domain name resolution also increases rapidly .
At present , registration of CN domains grows by 10,000 every month , with a total number of 430,000 .
The country code top-level domain name server run and managed by China 's Internet Network Information Center processes over 380 million domain name resolution requests every day , with an average of over 4,400 requests processed in one second and a peak value of 8,000 .
Faced with the fast development of the Internet , China 's Internet Network Information Center , China 's domain name registration administration , had to reevaluate this year the four original top-level nodes for country code domains across the country and redeployed CN domain top-level nodes based on the results of said reevaluation .
Based on local Internet development and software and hardware conditions at access organizations , it was decided to install a top-level node for country code domains in Shanghai .
We learn that Shanghai currently has 45,000 CN domain names and 26.6 percent of the population are Internet users . Its Internet penetration rate and application skills are second to none in the country .
The East China region surrounding Shanghai , with 130,000 CN domain names and 230,000 websites , is also a leader in terms of development .
Therefore Shanghai was chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan .
China Becomes World 's Largest Producer of Hard Alloy
NANCHANG , December 22 , Xinhua ( Reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen ) The hard alloy industry in China experienced rapid development in recent years , with the annual output exceeding one-third of the global production . In terms of production scale and output , China has become the world 's largest hard alloy producer . Offering a complete range of hard alloy types , China can produce most hard alloy products .
This is what the reporters learned on the 22nd from China 's Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Workshop currently being held .
Known as the " industrial tooth , " hard alloy is used in cutting tools , high pressure tools , and mechanics of mining and paving engineering for its high rigidity and abrasion resistance . Development of the hard alloy industry is vital to the overall development of the tungsten industry .
It was mentioned that China 's hard alloy industry started from scratch in the 1950s , and after continuously development , it now has made remarkable achievements .
In the early 1980s , when the world 's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons , China produced 5,000 tons of hard alloy a year ; stepping into the 21st century , the world 's annual hard alloy output is 38,000 , while China 's hard alloy production per year has soared rapidly to 15,000 tons , or more than one-third of the hard alloy output in the world .
China has also made significant progress in hard alloy export .
China 's annual hard alloy export was just 100 tons in 1986 , and the export volume had reached 2,500 tons by 2003 . The export volume is expected to reach more than 3,000 tons this year , which , like the output , also accounts for one-third of the circulation in worldwide hard alloy markets . The foreign currency earned annually through hard alloy export increased from below four million US dollars a year in the past to 70 million US dollars a year nowadays .
ADB Loan Supports Shanxi to Harness Coalbed and Coalfield Gas for Power
BEIJING , December 23 , Xinhua ( Reporter Jiang Guocheng ) The reporter learned from the Asian Development Bank 's China office on the 23rd that the ADB recently approved a loan of 117.4 million US dollars to help build a power plant that will harness the methane produced from coal mining in the southern part of the Shanxi Province .
The Coalbed Gas Development Demonstration Project will use the latest technologies to boost the output of coalbed and coalfield gas to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant that will soon be built .
Under the project , by the time of its completion in 2008 , the project will provide about 90,000 households and industrial and commercial users with at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed gas per year .
This will benefit some 410,000 in the Jincheng area .
Coal output in Shanxi accounts for about one third of the country 's total production .
The total cost of the project is estimated at 237 million US dollars , of which a loan of 20 million US dollars will be offered by Japan 's Bank for International Cooperation and a loan of 37.86 million US dollars will come from the Industrial Bank of China .
The Jincheng municipal government and two local mining / industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling 61.24 million US dollars .
The United States Trade and Development Agency also provided a grant of 500,000 US dollars .
Methane is called coalbed gas when it is obtained from wells built by drilling from the surface into underground coalbeds , and called coalfield gas when the it is produced in underground coal mining operations .
Methane is a highly explosive gas and needs to be drained first in coal mining operations to ensure a safe working environment .
Removal , capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions , contributing to the alleviation of global warming and climate change .
The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide .
Substituting methane for coal increases fuel cleanliness , improves coal mine efficiency , and results in cleaner air .
Hassing , an ADB senior project specialist , said the project was expected to yield a reduction of about 4.5 million tons in carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emission .
( International ) The Main Treasure of Israel Museum is a Forgery
JERUSALEM , December 24 , ( Xinhua ) James Snyder , director of the Israel Museum , said on the 24th that the main treasure of the museum , an ivory pomegranate , was confirmed a forgery a few days ago .
The ivory pomegranate was once considered the only relic discovered to date from the First Temple of Solomon 's age .
Snyder said in a statement that Israeli authorities conducted careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate .
Experts found it should be a relic from the Bronze Age , far earlier than the First Temple period of the Jews .
A line of text on the pomegranate , in Hebrew , reads : " Belonging to the Temple of Lord Yahweh , a holy thing to the priests . "
The inscription was confirmed to have been carved later .
The Israel Museum bought this ivory pomegranate for 550,000 US dollars from an anonymous collector in the 1980s .
Archaeological and relic experts had believed it was an artifact studded on the top of a scepter for priests of the First Temple , and the only cultural heritage left from that age .
Snyder said that before the ivory pomegranate was purchased , it had been authenticated by Israeli experts including an archaeologist named Nahman Avigad .
Israel 's Haaretz newspaper reported Avigad examined the artifact recklessly at that time using only a magnifier .
Avigad has personally denied the comment .
In recent months , Israeli police successively detected three major cases of fraudulence in cultural relics , summoning several hundred people for interrogation .
The police and the cultural heritage administration accidentally found the ivory pomegranate to be a forgery .
The police will press charges agains some people involved in this case next week .
In the 10th century B.C. , King Solomon of Judah built the First Temple on what is now the Temple Mount to keep holy artifacts such as the Ark of the Covenant and Noah 's Ark , but these holy artifacts were later destroyed .
Shenzhen Will Enforce the Use of " Reclaimed Water " in Some Buildings and Neighborhoods
GUANGZHOU , December 26 ( Xinhua ) As a major effort to build a " water-saving city , " Shenzhen will enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some larger buildings and neighborhoods . At present , relevant codes and regulations for the design of reclaimed water facilities are being formulated .
" Reclaimed water " mainly refers to nonpotable water that is for limited use and obtained from treating urban sewage or domestic sewage to a certain a level of water quality .
The quality of the water is somewhere between tap water and drained sewage .
A large quantity is usually used in toilet flushing , garden and farmland irrigation , road cleaning , car washing , urban fountains , and water refilling for cooling equipment .
An inquiry conducted by the Shenzhen Water Bureau shows Shenzhen once had more than 70 buildings equipped with a " reclaimed water " recycling system in the middle 1990s , but the builders had to give up the utilization as the cost of " reclaimed water " recycling was too high due to factors such as technology , design and management .
To have these pipelines play a real role , what needs to be done is to simply invest an additional 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in installing a " reclaimed water " treatment system .
If utilized , the over 70 existing " reclaimed water " pipelines can save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen in one single day , based on each neighborhood using 500 tons of " reclaimed water " per day .
It was said that Shenzhen will start its " reclaimed water " recycling by renovating the over 70 buildings that have existing " reclaimed water " systems , and will further expand the project after summing up experience .
In the meantime , the Shenzhen municipal water department will work with the urban planning and construction departments to formulate as soon as possible codes for the design of reclaimed water , and prescribe the enforcement of " reclaimed water " use in larger buildings .
The treated " reclaimed water " will be first used in urban green area irrigation .
27 Tsunami-Hit Zhejiang Tourists Out of Danger

( International ) The Auctioned Assets of Yugansk Won 't be Incorporated into Gazprom
MOSCOW , December 30 , Xinhua ( Reporter Song Shiyi ) Medvedev , head of the Russian Presidential Administration and chairman of Gazprom told the media on the 30th that Gazprom will merge with Rosneft as planned in January next year , but the assets of Yuganskneftegaz , Yukos Oil Company 's biggest subsidiary that Rosneft had purchased , will not be incorporated into the assets of Gazprom .
Talking about the reason why assets of the auctioned Yugansk will not be incorporated into Gazprom 's assets , Russian Minister of Industry and Energy Khristenko said on the same day that it is primarily because the state is already the principal shareholder of Gazpromneft and has no intention of increasing any shares beyond the controlling shares , reports also said .
He said Yugansk 's assets will be spun off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company .
On the 19th of this month , the Russian Federal Property Fund held an open auction for 76.79 percent of the shares of Yuganskneftegaz , Yukos Oil Company 's biggest subsidiary , and the newly formed BaikalFinansGroup won the bidding at a price of 9.35 billion US dollars .

According to authoritative fishery sources in Chennai , the capital of Tamil Nadu 's Province , the sudden disaster had huge impact on the province 's fishery production .
As there were no alerts or warnings , fishing boats were all berthed at the harbor .
The result was more than 7,000 motor boats and over 30,000 vessels destroyed to various degrees , accounting for more than 80 percent of all boats . There were also over 30,000 fishing nets that were destroyed .
A high official at the Chennai Fishery Federation said on the 31st in an interview with a reporter of our agency that even if the fishing boats were fixed , fishermen would not dare to sail off in the next few months , because they witnessed in person the atrocity and cruelty of the sea .
Some deprived of their relatives and some suffering losses of property , the fear in their mind would remain for quite a long time .
It is estimated that fishery output of the province in 2005 will drop around 30 percent from that of 2004 .
The tsunami disaster on the 26th impacted most coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu 's Province , making it the worst hit area in India .
By the 30th , the death toll in the province had reached 6230 , of whom most were fishermen .
It is said approximately 680,000 people in the province are affected by the tsunami , and 85 percent of them are in the fishery production .
Currently the Indian government is actively carrying out relief operations , trying to restore local fishermen 's life and fishery production as soon as possible .

( Hong Kong , Macau , Taiwan ) Research Institution Forecast : Hong Kong 's Economy to Grow at Around 6 percent in 2005
HONG KONG , January 11 , Xinhua ( Reporter Su Xiao ) The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong said on the 11th that the global economic environment remains favorable this year , and that Hong Kong 's economy is expected to develop at around 6 percent with an annualized 4.4 percent growth in the first quarter .
Richard Wong , Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU , pointed out in the press conference of the " Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast " that although interest rates are expected to be hiked this year , the economic growths of Hong Kong 's major trade partners keep sluggish , and the economic growths of the United States and the Mainland China are respectively 3.6 percent and 8.5 percent , the global economic environment remains promising in 2005 .
He said that according to the forecast of the center , the economic growth of Hong Kong will remain at around 6 percent in 2005 , but consumer prices will increase by 3 percent at the end of the year .
Job market adjustment remains sluggish with the unemployment rate declining slightly to around 6.3 percent by the end of this year .
Uncertainties caused by the fluctuations of the global oil price are still the main uncertain factor in Hong Kong 's economy .
Alan Siu , Executive Director of the Study Center , said that the economic growth momentum in the first quarter of this year will turn moderate , and GDP will grow at 4.4 percent . The slowdown reflects a gradual weakening in Hong Kong 's demand for foreign goods , as the economic growth of Hong Kong 's major trading partners tends to be even slower .
According to the report , the real GDP of Hong Kong in 2004 will record a robust growth of 8 percent with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5 percent , as deflation disappeared in the third quarter of last year .
Chow Yei-Ching , chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast at HKU , remarked that Hong Kong 's economy in 2004 showed a strong growth , and that reflects mainly the sound fundamentals of the local economy . The external sector is very competitive and is able to capitalize on the strong global economic growth and the rapid development of the market economy in mainland China last year . The ending of deflation will enable business owners to enjoy stronger cash flows .
