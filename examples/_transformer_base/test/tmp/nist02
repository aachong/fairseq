with the approval of relevant departments of the ministry of education , the guangdong provincial employment guidance center for graduates of higher learning is the only organization in china to be authorized to conduct certification for higher education on a nationwide scale .
the responsible person also revealed that a state - owned bank of a prefectural - level city , out of consideration for selecting officials , sent 36 middle - ranking officials and backbone business personnel to appraise their diploma , and only six of them were true .
it is understood that along with the appraisal , quite a number of private enterprises have also asked for verification , and the main items identified are the new recruits and college students .
the ministry found that many of the college students ' certificates were fake goods .
last year , a large enterprise set up a branch in the pearl river delta region , recruiting a group of college students .
the boss sent more than 30 employees ' academic credentials for appraisal , and found that 10 of them were false .
in recent years , quite a number of non - local institutions in guangdong have set up separate teaching posts to attract students to join the scheme , but in order to attract them , they have resorted to fraud when recruiting students , claiming that they are issued with certificates of national recognition , and producing a batch of false certificates upon graduation .

( comprehensive report from washington ) according to a report in the latest issue of the new york times , iraqi intelligence agencies have all along maintained close ties with the qazi , who is the mastermind of the 9 / 11 attacks .
it is reported that these two organizations will jointly command a terrorist organization in the kurdistan area in northern iraq .
the us central intelligence agency has always taken a skeptical attitude toward statements by iraqi president saddam hussein and the qazi for links .
in the past , officials of the " hawks " in the bush administration who supported military actions against iraq have been trying to find out evidence of links between sonny doo and kaitda .
these officials praised the report carried by the new york weekly the day before yesterday , saying that the report was the latest basis for their support of their arguments .
it is reported that there is an ansa muslim guerrilla force in iraq 's kurdistan district composed of kurdistan and arab people who had received training at the camp in aoma .

the spies also said that in 1992 iraq hosted a leader of qatar , who was a native of egypt .
us officials warned that the kurdish patriotic union may make a big issue of the relevant reports in order to prove that the us plan to overthrow the woo regime is justified .
cheney fails in middle east visit : gulf daily
( agence france - presse , dubai ) - the gulf countries press said on monday that u . s . vice president cheney 's middle east visit failed .
cheney 's visit was to persuade middle east countries to support us attacks on iraq .
cheney went to kuwait monday after visiting all the gulf countries , but even the united states ' most loyal allies are opposed to attacking baghdad .
the salem arab newspaper said , " what the vice president heard was that the united states must stop israeli terrorist activities and prevent israel from possessing weapons of mass destruction . "
the paper also pointed out : " if the united states continues not considering the interests of middle east countries , it will lose its interests in the gulf region . "
the uae gulf daily also said : " this is a new failure of the united states in the middle east after it has run into snags in europe .
most of the us european allies are openly opposed to the attack on iraq . "
cheney denied in bahrain yesterday that his middle east trip was aimed at organizing military strikes against iraq .
at a joint press conference with bahrain 's crown prince sahman , he said he denied that some people believed that the only thing he was interested in during his trip was organizing a military attack on iraq .

cheney arrived in israel on monday evening for a visit . it is expected that he will meet with israeli prime minister ehud olmert to discuss the latest developments in the israeli - palestinian situation .

although the overall crime rate in britain has decreased , there has been a 13 percent increase in street crimes between 2000 and 2001 .
the situation in london was even more shocking : in september and november alone , 13,248 robberies were reported , more than double the figure of 8,814 cases in the same period of the previous year .
the government also said that the increase in crimes was mainly due to the increase in the number of mobile phone robberies . last year , more than 700,000 mobile phone robberies occurred nationwide .
this was the first time that british police focused their crackdown on street hooligans and robberies and previously concentrated their efforts on cracking down on illegal possession of firearms and on selling of drugs on the streets .
the new plan will be implemented first in 10 streets where crimes are concentrated .
police will step up patrols in these streets and provide more protection to victims .

singapore airlines ' air accident investigation committee delays prosecutors ' suspicion
( taipei news ) the singapore airlines air crash accident has been going on for one and a half years , but the report on the air crash investigation report of the taiwan flight safety council has been delayed again and again , with the result that the taoyuan air inspection agency 's investigation operation has stagnated . the prosecutor 's office has questioned some myths in the accident and the flight safety council has promised to submit the investigation report in april .

the chung - kuo shih - pao reported yesterday that the taoyuan prefectural investigation bureau , which is responsible for investigating the criminal suspect after the air crash , had several disputes over its investigation rights with the flying an investigation unit .
since the air crash , wang tiansheng , procurator general of the taoyuan prefectural investigation and prosecution bureau , has been promoted to be the procurator general of taichung , chen shouhuang has been replaced , and huang chih - hsin , the prosecutor in charge of the case , has also been transferred to the north inspection , and the case has been taken over by jiangyuan .
the flight safety council had originally indicated that the investigation report could be completed by the end of last year and then postponed to the end of january . after the change was completed in february , there was still no follow - up report . with the prosecution 's urging , the air safety council promised to deliver the report in april .
since the pz - 006 flight ends in los angeles , families of some of the victims have already brought a huge amount of civil compensation to the us court , requesting compensation from singapore airlines as well as taiwan civil aviation authority .
the claim made by the families of the victims is tantamount to accusing taiwan 's control tower of being held responsible for negligence . therefore , the investigation conclusions of the taoyuan prefectural inspection department are particularly eye - catching .

several hundred thousand u.s. and south korean soldiers conduct large - scale exercise
( seoul , new york ) several hundred thousand us and south korean soldiers will conduct a military exercise of the largest scale simulating the korean conflict on thursday , drawing pyongyang 's attack on it as a provocative act of war .
on the eve of a week - long military exercise , us military officers said that the exercise was purely defensive in nature , but it occurred after the seoul authorities warned that the korean issue should not be ignored .
this was the largest military exercise since the 1950 - 53 korean war , and because it did not conclude a formal treaty on ending the conflict on the korean peninsula , it became the last front of the cold war in the world , with nearly two million troops living on the border .
the us - rok coalition command in seoul said that the exercise from 21 to 27 march will be the first time to test its effectiveness by combining two different joint military exercises .
this means that hundreds of thousands of soldiers will join , but the military has not disclosed details .
a spokesman for the coalition command said that almost every us military unit and south korean military unit on the korean peninsula and us troops from outside will be mobilized this exercise .

south korea also has 650,000 troops .
the joint command claimed that this exercise was a combination of the computerized military exercise and the annual " little eagle " exercise .
in the past few years , the company mobilized 500,000 south korean troops and 30,000 us troops ( including 20,000 us troops from outside ) in the exercise alone .

it has been disclosed that there are about 10,000 korean people living in the liangmahe river in the dongcheng and chaoyang districts in beijing , including korean people from north and south korea . they are mainly engaged in business in north korea 's style restaurants , bars , and other trades . because they are of the korean nationality , they are also on good terms with each other regardless of where they come from .
in the past , the korean authorities did not regard it as a key target for monitoring because there were not many people of the korean nationality in beijing , nor were they involved in many criminal cases like xinjiang people and heinan people .
according to the report , after the 14 march incident , the public security department first " asked " the doctor of germany , who was in charge of the 25 koreans , to " talk " with the public security department and immediately sent him to the airport to ask him to leave the country immediately .

it is enough to destroy medium - sized planets by colliding with the earth .
( florida , united states ) a small planet can destroy a medium - sized city but it was not discovered in advance within 460,000 km of the earth . astronomers only learned of this four days later .
astronomers find it difficult to detect the small planet , measuring about 50 meters in diameter from the sun .
the small planet passed the earth on march 8 , but it is far away by march 12 when it is discovered .
williams , who is located at the international astronomical association center in cambridge , massachusetts , has helped determine the azimuth .
from the perspective of astronomy , the planet is very close to the earth because the moon is 400,000 km away from the earth .
williams told florida 's " today daily " on wednesday , " the key is that the satellite should be detected before it is issued from the sun . "
only in this way will astronomers be able to determine the orbit of the asteroids and predict whether it will impact the earth .
when a large and almost small star hit the earth in 1908 , it crashed a 32 - kilometer wide pit in siberia 's forest .

beijing 's no . 1 intermediate people 's court yesterday sentenced american chinese engineer fang fuming to five years ' imprisonment on charges of illegally obtaining state secrets and offering a bribe on behalf of a company .
the case drew protests from the united states .
a spokesperson for the us embassy in china said that fang fuming will be expelled after the prison term expires .
the prison term will be adjusted according to the duration of his imprisonment .
the us embassy had sent a diplomat to hear the hearing .
fang fuming 's lawyer said that his clients had been in jail for two years , but china said they had not been so long .
xinhua news agency confirmed the verdict .
it said that from 1995 to 1999 , fang fuming received 35 documents containing state secrets and bribed chinese civil servants with 245,000 us dollars ( about 45,000 singapore dollars ) to assist foreign investors in bidding for china 's power projects .
fang fuming is an electrical engineering consultant for foreign companies in china and other parts of asia .
fang fuming 's lawyer cohen said that fang fuming denied offering a bribe , claiming that he was the victim of a corrupt chinese power official .

china does not want to confirm whether hu jintao will visit the united states as planned
( beijing comprehensive ) the warming - up of sino - us relations , which had once been warming up due to us president bush 's visit to china , yesterday confirmed abolishing the plan for the visit of a naval task force to the united states this year and refused to determine whether state vice president hu jintao will visit the united states as scheduled .
in answering a question at a regular news conference , foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said : " as far as i know , the chinese naval task group is preparing to visit foreign countries as planned . their plans do not include the us ports . "
when a reporter asked twice whether hu jintao 's plan to visit the united states was affected or not , she asked to clarify whether an earlier reply could be interpreted as that hu jintao 's visit to the united states would be carried out as scheduled in april , zhang qiyue was unwilling to make more comments or confirmed .
zhang qiyue only repeatedly criticized the us side for " doing a series of things in violation of the three sino - us joint communiques " in a short period of one month after bush 's visit to china , and demanded that the us side " stop using the taiwan issue to interfere in china 's internal affairs . "
on the other hand , in washington , it is not appropriate for the united states to ignore china 's warnings that sino - us relations are experiencing a " cold wind " and insist on allowing taiwan 's defense secretary to attend the " us - taiwan defense summit " in florida .
beijing has time and again attacked us defense secretary tang yao - ming for issuing a visa to taiwan earlier this month .
tang yao - ming also met with two us senior officials at that time .
state department spokesman richard boucher was questioned by reporters at the regular news conference by reporters on china 's complaints on this matter , but he clearly tried his utmost to avoid launching a verbal war with china .
he said : " our stand after the talks is known to all .
if you ask me about this everyday , i would like to explain it everyday . china wants to ask this question everyday , and we want to explain it everyday . "
he said : " our position remains unchanged . these are normal contacts between us and the people of taiwan . we will continue to do so . "
zhang qiyue also confirmed russian media reports yesterday that at russian president putin 's request , chinese state president jiang zemin talked with him over the phone the night before . the two sides mainly exchanged views on the issue of mutually beneficial cooperation between china and russia .
both sides held that the mutually beneficial cooperation between china and russia conforms to the interests of the two countries and the two peoples .
