we do n't want to do so . "

north korea to withdraw from nuclear non - proliferation treaty
( agence france - presse , washington , 15th ) - u . s . and north korea 's stand has been upgraded from an " axis of evil " to an international crisis . efforts to spread global nuclear non - proliferation over the past decades will probably fall short of success .
pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the nuclear non - proliferation treaty on the 10 th of this month , dropping a standoff with washington .
analysts said the world 's efforts to curb nuclear proliferation are feared to have failed , and the treaty between india and pakistan , not signatory of the treaty , was seriously damaged when they entered the nuclear club in 1998 .
four days after pyongyang took the above actions , the five permanent members of the un security council have taken preventive diplomatic actions against the crisis .
russia said it would send a special envoy to pyongyang to propose ending the deadlock while china suggested hosting a compromise dialogue between the united states and north korea .
britain and france are discussing the crisis in london .
the international atomic energy agency has warned it may ask the security council to take action if pyongyang refuses to give up its nuclear program .
with regard to the actions of russia and china , many us observers feel that such talks may force moscow and beijing to decide whether or not to vote against north korea .
other countries that may have nuclear capability , such as iran and libya , will certainly keep a close watch on the development of the north korean crisis .
they will pay attention to north korea 's withdrawal from nuclear non - proliferation treaties and not being punished , or obtaining huge us funds to exchange for a halt to nuclear weapons .
" if north korea is considered capable of withdrawing from nuclear non - proliferation treaties , they may take the same action without paying a price , " said former state department arms control official ahern .
novsei of the institute of international economics believes that north korea may make a tactical mistake because its decision to withdraw from the non - proliferation treaty will make the international community more determined to resolve this issue .

he said they will file an appeal .

dahill asked : " if we have evidence that iraq possesses nuclear and biological weapons , why would n't we have made it known to the world ? just as kennedy , president of cuba , held photos of an offensive missile 40 years ago , immediately instructed ambassador to the united nations shi wensheng to release the same information at the un general assembly . "
speaking to the un security council on whether iraq would abide by its arms reduction order , dahill lashed out at president bush at the washington national press club .

the meeting was mainly attended by the un weapons inspectors ' report no. 1441 on whether or not iraq would comply with the un security council 's resolution on disarming iraq .
white house spokesman fleischer said that blix did not provide any reason for people to believe that iraq was following resolution 1441 of the un security council .
he told reporters : " there is no news from new york that the world today has received no comfort . it is believed that hussein has shown the weapons inspectors that he is disarmed .
the situation is just the opposite . "
asked when the united states will put forward a follow - up resolution aimed at implementing the un security council resolution 1441 , fleischer said that he was " premature " but that the united states would consult with its allies on the contents of the resolution .

indonesian authorities refuse us embassy 's security plan

the " jakarta post " and the state - run " antara " news agency reported today that jakarta authorities had ignored the plan to replace the current plan to separate the embassy and ambassador 's residence from the outside world on grounds of damaging the beautiful scenery .
jakarta officials quoted mayor sudimittal as saying that a wall could be built , but the precondition is that the hall should be built three meters away from the existing boundary .

study shows father gene may affect child birth time
( agence france - presse , paris , 28 th ) according to a danish research report published in the british medical weekly , which will publish saturday , father 's genes may affect the date of birth of children .
about five percent of pregnant women will produce late - production , that is , the time of pregnancy will reach 294 days .
at present , we know that this issue will cause health problems to mothers and children , but it is still a mystery as to why it is caused .
danish researchers tracked 43,000 births between 1980 and 1992 , with at least two children in each of the targeted mothers and having late production during their first pregnancy .
data for the previous two production periods were used for the purpose of analysis .
overall , nearly 20% of these women have the same experience during their first pregnancy .
however , when the first and second children were born out of different father , the ratio fell slightly to over 15% .
" there are already a lot of this , " said alison , head of the study 's report .
this means that if your partners ( the second child ) are the same , then you may have a longer pregnancy of 30 percent above the same partner . "
the report said : " women who change their partners during pregnancy can reduce the risk of repeated late - production .
we believe this is a new discovery .
and the result implies that the time of birth may be determined by the genes of my father . "

xinhua news agency , washington , january 8 ( reporter : tan xinmu ) - a spokesman for the us defense department 's missile defense agency announced on the 8 th that the us military had decided to cancel the two missile interception tests scheduled for the first half of this year because the new type of missile - interceptor missile had fallen behind the original development process .

the boeing company originally planned to begin its flight testing of the new type of boost rocket carrying " interceptor " missiles in 2000 , but the test was postponed due to technical reasons .

both the missile interception tests conducted in july 2000 and december last year failed because the " interceptor " failed to separate from the interceptor missile .
on 17 december last year , us president bush ordered the department of defense to start deploying the missile defense system in order to build a preliminary missile defense system by september 2004 .
however , many experts believe that technically speaking , the time is not yet ripe for deploying the missile defense system .

economic analysts believe that this is mainly because uncertain factors such as the united states ' possible war against iraq , a sharp fall in the stock market , and a weak job market have curbed consumer enthusiasm , and this has become the most important reason for the sharp slowdown of the us economy in the fourth quarter .

( international ) austrian researchers find spellitus cells causing chronic pain
xinhua news agency , vienna , february 20 ( reporter lin chuan ) researchers at the university of vienna in austria found a group of nerve cells with a long memory . these cells will be slightly excited by the pain and take another step forward in searching for chronic illness .
the chronic pain patients are extremely sensitive to the pain and must eventually bear the pain in their daily lives .
however , people are almost totally unaware of the cause of the disease .
according to a report by the austrian news agency , a research team led by juergen sangchle , director of the nerve science department of the institute of the university of vienna , found that some spillings had not performed exceptionally well under normal conditions and would be excited after suffering from pain .
the pain was strongly stimulated , and the reaction was enhanced .
however , unlike other nerve cells , the cells of this group will become too sensitive to the stimulation of pain , even if they are only stimulated by insignificant pain .
researchers also found that there is a special channel in the polio cells , which will be opened when the cells are stimulated , and calcium plasma is flowing into the cells , thus further triggering chain reactions .
santol believes that the reason why those suffering from chronic pain were too sensitive to minor pain was that the nerve cells in the polio had a lasting memory and " traces of pain " were preserved .
he said that this discovery could lead people to look for ways to eliminate this memory .
