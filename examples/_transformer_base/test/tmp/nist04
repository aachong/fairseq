( agence france - presse , washington , 18th ) - u . s . democratic candidates seeking to replace bush and become the host of the white house have one after another pointed out that the latest suicide bombing attack in baghdad , which caused heavy casualties , is evidence of failure of u . s . policy toward iraq .
the attack killed at least 25 people and wounded about 30 others . it was the most serious attack in baghdad since the us occupied iraq .
bush 's democratic opponent sternly criticized bush 's iraq policy . some opponents said that the attack was the latest proof of bush 's failure in his policy toward iraq .
edwards , us senator from north carolina , told cbs : " our current policy has failed . i do n't know what the government is unwilling to change . "
he said , " obviously , the first thing we need to do is to internationalize the iraqi security forces , and the other thing is to hand over the interim government to the united nations . "
former president carter said in public with democratic candidate deane that the iraq war led by the united states " has proven that it is not only based on erroneous intelligence and misleading statements , " but the latest attack " has also continued to show that this is a tragedy . "

iraqi guerrillas fight us helicopters with high - tech weapons
( agence france - presse , washington , 18th ) - senior u . s . military figures said that iraqi resistance forces attacked u . s . helicopters with more and more sophisticated weapons .
a group of senior military officials familiar with a classified military report told the new york times today that a confidential military research report found iraqi guerrillas attacked american helicopters by using rocket - propelled grenades and more advanced thermal tracking and surface - to - air missiles .
they said that this was a study conducted by iraq this month before its three attacks on us military helicopters , but the latest three attacks would only serve to confirm the conclusions of the research report .
the main purpose of this military research report is to provide a method for us pilots to avoid attacks by iraqi guerrillas , and officials concerned are unwilling to discuss new findings .
however , looking at the method of a new wave of attacks in iraq , we cannot help worrying that iraqi guerrillas have carefully studied the combat pattern of us planes .
researchers found that iraqi guerrillas used salem - 16 shoulder - to - shoulder missiles more than once , and this is particularly worrisome .
this kind of missile with sophisticated navigation systems makes it very difficult for pilots to avoid .
" every time our aircraft was shot down , it was a great victory in the strategy of the enemy , " a senior us air officer in the persian gulf region said .
not only did the news reports wantonly spread , but the enemy also made a verdict of defeat . therefore , the enemy considers this a very useful trick . "
since 25 october last year , nine us military helicopters have been shot down or crashed , killing at least 49 us soldiers .

the nobel peace prize winner said : " in the past year and a half , i have spent a lot of time strongly opposing this iraq war which is totally unnecessary and unfair .
although i have made tremendous efforts , the war is already in progress , and it has now proven that this war is not only based on erroneous intelligence and misleading statements , but also continues to show that it is a tragedy . "
carter praised deane as a powerful " peace supporter . " although he did not officially give his reply in the statement , the us television station reported carter 's remarks .
former governor of the left - wing northern state deane , facing the middle - of - the - road line in the southern states , retired general clark from arkansas may not be able to do anything , but carter 's support may increase his chances of winning victory in the southern states of his conservative stance and religious consciousness .
carter said during a recent tv interview that he believed that tito was the most likely candidate for the democratic party to run against bush .

( agence france - presse , paris , 29 th ) heavy snowstorms cover half of western europe and northern europe , causing great traffic and railway confusion and forcing hundreds of flights between britain , germany and denmark to be cancelled .
in london , a spokesman for the haas airport said more than 200 flights were cancelled last night due to accumulated snow , and 80 flights were suspended early this morning .
snow has also affected the other two airports near london , with 18 flights cancelled due to weather conditions .
in germany , the winter weather has led to the cancellation of at least 60 flights to frankfurt international airport , and frankfurt airport is germany 's largest airport .
air traffic may be affected by weather conditions throughout the day , while the rest of the flights will fly to frankfurt , transport authorities said .
paris , march 6 , 2007 ( afp ) road traffic restrictions have been lifted in france following a snowstorm last night , but similar measures have been lifted in other parts of france this morning .
all services at the main paris airport were reported to be in normal condition and flights were delayed at the charles de gaulle airport yesterday due to accumulated snow and fog .
however , the paris airport authority suggests that passengers on board the air must first find out whether their flights take off and land on schedule before leaving home .
most parts of france are covered by white snow , apart from the central coast of the country .
both taiwan and japan are democratic countries and have the obligation and responsibility to make joint efforts to consolidate democracy in asia .
in order to publicize the value of democracy , the chinese government will establish the " taiwan democratic foundation " in the near future . international political party cooperation is one of the priorities of its work .
the dpp hopes to share its experience in democratic development with other democratic parties in order to contribute to peace , stability and prosperity in asia and realize the ideal of a " democratic union in asia " at an early date .
today , when the international situation changes with each passing day , the regional forces will change a slight move in one part of the situation as a whole , and every country 's security is tested .
as far as the asia - pacific region is concerned , since the united states launched a war against iraq last month , north korea , which regards itself as an independent nuclear power , has test - fired missiles several times , flying over japan 's territorial air space , and china has long actively expanded its armaments and deployed ballistic missiles aimed at taiwan .
all this has already posed a serious threat to the security of taiwan , japan , and the asia - pacific region .
only formal security mechanisms will be needed to discuss and resolve these issues related to the consolidation of democracy and security .
it goes without saying that today 's meeting is the first official dialogue on security issues between the dpp and other diet members of japan 's ruling party .
i also hope that in addition to the bilateral dialogues between taiwan and japan , the united states , japan , the rok , and other neighboring countries in the asia - pacific region will be able to cooperate in promoting the establishment of a " security dialogue mechanism " and support taiwan 's participation in regional multilateral dialogues in order to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .
today is an important moment encouraging us to continue to advance on the road of reform , and we would like to give our greatest affirmation to all comrades in the party who can embody the will of our party and make concerted efforts to achieve the reform objective .
" the withdrawal of a political party from the radio , film and television media " is the most basic requirement for implementing the media reform . it is also the consistent ideal of the dpp . the ruling party can only speed up the pace of reform , not obstruct or burden .
we also know that to promote this goal , the party 's public affairs comrades should take the lead in withdrawing from the media operation . this is a small step in the media reform , but it is also a key step .
in the period of enforcing martial law in the past , many comrades within the party , in order to strive for the space of opening up to the outside world , have thrown themselves into such arduous tasks as setting up the fourth station and local radio station in the hope of breaking through the existing limitations and increasing the capacity to promote the transformation of the media 's environment .
for example , comrade cai tongrong did a lot of painstaking work in those years in order to give birth to the fourth wireless tv station , and finally he had the birth of " popular support . "
this move has a considerable impact on the media as a whole . in particular , it has broken down the long - standing monopoly of the three television stations and created more space for cable tv stations to promote their development .
however , we must understand that because of the limitations of the historical environment and because there are many extraordinary things in the process of promoting reform , the space of media space has become completely open and free today , representing that the tasks for the current stage have been accomplished and that there are bound to be some sacrifices in order to continue the process of reform .
the standing committee announced that all the party and government comrades would withdraw from the radio , film , and television media operation before 5 september to take the lead in fulfilling their commitments to the people .
we are very pleased to see that the party 's ideals and objectives are taken into account , including cai tongrong , chang chun - hung , zhou qingyu , hou shuisheng , gao mengding , huang naima , and shen gongming , who have made a lot of contributions to the democratic movement .
ruling the country is not enjoying the power , but increasing the sense of responsibility .
in the process of the dpp 's administration , there are bound to be setbacks and ups and downs . we will always be able to challenge the power to advance and lead taiwan in building projects to deepen democracy . at the same time , we will merge with the universal values of global democracy , peace , and prosperity .
this is because we always believe that the people are the masters of this country . the responsibility of the democratic progressive party is to upgrade the pioneering spirit of " honesty , diligence , and loving the native land " to the bright prospect of " reform , progress , and good life " and lay a foundation for lasting peace and stability for the 23 million taiwan people .
for a long time , the dpp has played the role of " separation of the government " in the efforts to develop taiwan 's diplomacy and has achieved brilliant results .
despite the continuous suppression of the chinese communists , we have never retired because our destiny is in our own hands , and even without rich resources , the dpp is still advancing step by step , thus expanding taiwan 's international participation space .
" diversified diplomacy " is the principal axis of the dpp 's overall foreign policy . in the past year , we have successfully exchanged experiences and exchanged experiences with countries in the region , with the " asian free and democratic union " as our platform , targeting the economic challenges of the east asian region , democratic reform of political parties , removing money rights politics , resolving globalization and poverty , promoting political propaganda and communication , and youth 's participation in political affairs .
in march next year , i will also officially take over the presidency of the " asian freedom and democracy union . " i hope to create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community in its capacity as the leader of an international organization .
in addition , the dpp has also actively participated in relevant affairs since it became an official member of the " international freedom union " last year .
in addition to sending officials to serve as human rights commissioner at the secretariat of the london headquarters , they will also cooperate with other member parties and hold political reform seminars in central and south america and europe .
on 28 september , our party celebrated its 17 th birthday .
the 17 - year - old democratic progressive party has always adhered to the ideal of democracy and is full of strength for reform and progress .
it is precisely because we have all along stood on the side of democratic reform that we can gain the trust of the people of taiwan , and the responsibility and mission we will shoulder in the future will be even more serious and heavy .
when we took over the burden of being the ruling party three years ago , the ruling party of the past tried to make a roundabout trip six times to revise the constitution .
from the 1991 handling of a full - scale election of the national assembly , handling of direct presidential elections in 1994 , freezing the provincial government 's organization in 1997 , and putting the national people 's congress in a very serious position by 2000 , these tortuous course of constitutional revision is actually the track of strengthening the legitimacy of sovereignty and democracy of the people of taiwan .
if we regard being directly elected by the president in 1996 as the most important symbol of taiwan becoming a sovereign and independent democratic country , then by 2006 this " complete " country is already 10 years old .
after 10 years of practice , we must think about what we will pursue as a democratic country with independent sovereignty .
i must say that in the next stage , we should further pursue the deepening of democracy and a more efficient constitutional system in order to lead the taiwan people in accepting the grim challenge of the new century .
asia is the largest continent in the world , with an area accounting for nearly 30 percent of the world 's total land area . at present , its population accounts for about 60 percent of the world 's total , and its total economic volume accounts for one fourth of the world 's total . it should and can make outstanding contributions to world peace and development .
asia has a long and splendid culture . the huang he and the yangtze river valley , the indian river and the henghe river valley , the youngest river , and the chryvas valley are famous places of human civilization .
over a long historical process , the people of asia have written a brilliant chapter for the development of human civilization .
in modern times , asia has gone through many vicissitudes of life and suffered repeated hardships . the people of all countries have made unremitting efforts to liberate and develop asia and scored tremendous achievements .
however , there is still a long way to go in order to bring about a new rise and rejuvenation in asia .
to strengthen cooperation , promote development , and bring about a pent - up is the inevitable course for the rise and rejuvenation of asia , and is also where the fundamental interests of the people of asia lie .
under the new situation in the new century , the development of asia is facing new opportunities .
peace and development are still the main themes of the present age , and the overall peaceful international environment has provided favorable external conditions for the development of asia .
economic globalization is developing in depth , the scientific and technological revolution in the world is advancing by leaps and bounds , and the optimization , reorganization , and industrial transfer of international production factors are being accelerated . this is beneficial for asian countries to utilize international capital , introduce advanced technology , open up international markets , and promote their own economic development .
asia is rich in resources and has a vast market . it is a region with the greatest economic vitality in the world today , and its development potential is enormous .
there are many people and not well - developed people . these are the two major national conditions of china .
china has 1.3 - billion people . no matter how small the issue is , taking 1.3 - billion people as a gift will become a very big problem . no matter how much financial and material resources it is , it will become very low per capita .
this is something that the chinese leaders must firmly remember at any time .
to solve the problem of 1.3 billion people , we cannot rely on others but on ourselves .
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have made great achievements in construction . meanwhile , we have also made detours and missed some opportunities .
since the beginning of reform and opening up in 1978 , we have finally found a correct road of development .
this is : the chinese people independently build socialism with chinese characteristics .
the essence of this road is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop the productive forces , and respect and protect the freedom of the chinese people in pursuing happiness .
china 's reform and opening up , from the rural areas to cities , and from the economic field to the political , cultural , and social fields .
in the final analysis , every step of its deepening is aimed at giving free rein to the vitality of all labor , knowledge , technology , management , and capital and vying with one another to break out , so that all sources of creating social wealth will flow in full .
in recent years , profound changes are taking place in the world , science and technology are changing with each passing day , the level of the world 's productive forces is constantly improving , and the world market is forging closer ties , thus creating historical opportunities for the development of all countries .
however , it is noteworthy that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , infectious diseases , and environmental deterioration are still threatening world stability and development .
the negative impact of economic globalization has increased the risk and price of developing countries ' economic and social development , and some developing countries are even facing the danger of being marginalized .
at present , although the world economy is gradually recovering , it still faces many uncertain factors .
the doha round of multilateral trade talks has suffered setbacks , and trade protectionism and other complicated factors have added to the difficulties of developing countries .
what is gratifying is that the vast numbers of developing countries are forging ahead in an active manner , are determined to carry out reform with keen determination , and are making great efforts to make the country prosperous .
on the international stage , relying on the non-aligned movement and the group of 77 , the developing countries have strengthened unity and cooperation , made important contributions to safeguarding their own legitimate rights and interests and changing their irrational international political and economic order , and become an important force in promoting democratization of international relations .
at the same time , the exchange and cooperation between the developing countries has also yielded rich results and economic exchanges between them have become even more frequent .
south - south cooperation has been constantly enriched , perfected , and updated from the antara mountain range to the mekong river , from the amur union to the establishment of the african union , and from the form and mechanism to the means .
the past year was also a year in which the friendly and cooperative relations between china and canada continued to develop in an all - round way .
the trade volume between the two countries has maintained a momentum of growth , and the total volume of trade is close to $ 10 billion .
high - level exchanges have been frequent ; a number of important political figures , such as the canadian foreign minister , the minister of defense , the minister of the environment , and the minister of international cooperation , have visited china one after another ; and china 's supreme court president , commerce minister , and other senior officials have also paid visits to canada . more importantly , the two premiers have successfully exchanged visits with each other .
premier wen jiabao 's recent visit to canada has the significance of carrying forward the cause pioneered by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future , and has injected new vitality into the further development of sino - canadian relations , thus laying a solid foundation for the continuous development of friendly cooperation in all fields between the two countries in depth and in breadth .
china and canada will continue to strengthen cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields , and strive to achieve the goal of doubling the total volume of bilateral trade in 2010 .
all overseas chinese compatriots and friends ,
although you live abroad , you always have your heart in your hometown , are concerned about the construction and development of the motherland , and at every crucial moment you always worry about the worries of the people of the motherland , enjoy the happiness of the people of the motherland , and swing with the pulse of the motherland .
last year , after sars and floods occurred in some areas of china , you expressed your deep concern and best wishes to the people of the motherland through the internet , letters , telephone calls , and donations . chinese from all walks of life have held many large donations and charity performances . after the successful launch of the " shenzhou v " manned space flight , you have sent congratulatory messages , letters , and greeting cards one after another . everyone feels proud of china 's achievements in aerospace science and technology .
during premier wen jiabao 's visit to canada , hundreds of overseas chinese and chinese students went to the airport and capitol hill to welcome premier wen jiabao 's visit , and many deeply moved scenes .
i would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you . i believe that in the new year you will continue to make greater contributions to china 's prosperity and strengthening and to the development of sino - canadian relations , and to china 's complete reunification and comprehensive rejuvenation .
first , political mutual trust should be strengthened and strategic cooperation deepened .
china and france , as permanent members of the un security council , are both countries with important influence on international affairs .
our two countries agree to promote multi - polarization of the world , advocate safeguarding the authority of the united nations , and are willing to promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order that conforms with the will of the peoples of all countries .
the two countries share a broad consensus and common interests in dealing with various challenges facing mankind and in properly handling major international affairs .
we are willing to strengthen dialogue and consultation with france on major issues such as fighting terrorism , preventing proliferation , cracking down on transnational crime , promoting common development , and strengthening the role of the united nations , and carry out close cooperation with france in safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .
second , it is necessary to strengthen economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutually beneficial and mutually complementary results .
china is the largest developing country in the world , and is making all - out efforts to carry out modernization and has a vast market .
france is a developed country with a leading edge in economic and scientific and technological fields .
the economies of our two countries are strongly complementary , and there is great potential for economic and trade cooperation .
since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always attached great importance to developing relations with africa and formulated a series of principles and policies .
we have always upheld the five principles of peaceful coexistence , respected the african countries for independently choosing their own political systems and paths of development , provided as much assistance as possible to african countries , carried out economic and technological cooperation , supported the unity and cooperation among african countries , supported the international community in attaching importance to peace and development in africa , supported african countries in taking part in international affairs on an equal footing , strengthened consultation and cooperation between china and african countries , and jointly safeguarded the rights and interests of developing countries .
sino - african friendship goes back to ancient times and enjoys popular support .
since the founding of new china , we have always firmly supported the cause of national liberation in africa and sincerely assisted african countries in developing their national economies .
chinese experts , doctors , teachers , and workers sent to africa work side by side with the local people , live together in friendship and love .
in international affairs , china and the african countries understand and support each other and have become mutually trusted partners .
the chinese people will never forget that china smoothly regained its legitimate seat in the united nations at the 26th un general assembly in 1971 precisely with the energetic support of the vast numbers of developing countries , including african countries .
in recent years , mutual political trust between china and africa at various levels and between personnel of various circles has been deepened . economic and trade cooperation has been fruitful . friendly exchanges in the cultural , educational , public health , scientific , technological , and sports fields have developed vigorously . the china - africa cooperation forum , which was founded at the beginning of the century , has set up a new platform for the development of sino - african relations and for deepening cooperation .
china and africa have decided to establish a new long - term , stable , equal , and mutually beneficial partnership , and sino - african friendly cooperation has entered a new stage of comprehensive development .
seven years after nixon 's visit to china and the publication of the shanghai communique , the carter administration accepted the chinese stand on the taiwan issue and established sino - us diplomatic relations .
this incident and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states have opened a new chapter in sino - us relations .
in the early days of reagan 's administration , there were fierce confrontations between china and the united states on the taiwan issue .
through arduous negotiations , the two governments issued the famous " 17 august " communique in 1982 , and reached an agreement on the gradual resolution of the issue of arms sales to taiwan .
the shanghai communique , the sino - us communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations , and the " 17 august " communique jointly constitute the political cornerstone of sino - us relations .
in the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations , sino - us relations have , on the whole , been stable , and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have increased , despite the struggle between the two countries on the taiwan issue .
in the 1980s and early 1990s , drastic changes took place in eastern europe , the soviet union disintegrated , and the cold war ended . the most profound changes have taken place in the international situation since world war ii .
the united states took the lead in imposing sanctions on china , announcing the sale of 150 - 16 fighter planes , linking the human rights issue with most favored nation treatment , and allowing lee teng - hui to visit the united states , with the result that sino - us relations fell to a low ebb .
with the rapid development of china 's economy , china 's international status has been raised continuously .
more and more people in the united states have come to realize that the improvement and development of sino - us relations are in the interests of both the united states and china .
half a year ago , in this hall , we successfully activated the process of the six - party talks and set the direction for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .
over the past six months , the various parties have carried out incessant dialogue and consultations , made a great deal of in - depth preparations for a new round of talks , and through this process , enhanced understanding of each other 's stances .
at present , all the parties are looking forward to discussing substantive issues in the second round of talks and to achieving concrete results , they agree to resolve mutual concerns through concerted and consistent steps , and they hope to maintain the peace process opened up by the six - party talks .
all these constitute an important foundation for our talks today .
the significance of the second round of talks lies in starting discussions on substantive issues , which marks a new step forward in the peace talks process .
the current round of talks will involve the establishment of a specific objective for resolving the nuclear issue , the exploration of first - stage measures for resolving the nuclear issue , and the study of ways for the progress of the sustained talks .
as the talks are going deeper , we will still deal with more difficulties and meet more challenges , but this is precisely the responsibility bestowed on us by history as well as the hope placed on us by the international community .
our six - party meeting here represents the strong political aspiration of the governments and peoples of the six countries to seek peace .
the purpose of our talks was to expand consensus , not highlight differences , and to resolve problems rather than intensify contradictions .
the chinese side believes that all sides are aware of the peace mission on their shoulders and , with a constructive attitude , the spirit of cooperation and understanding , respect each other , display flexibility , and narrow the gap .
after more than three days of consultations , the agenda for the second round of six - party talks in beijing completed .
i would like to express my gratitude to the governments , leaders , representatives , and working personnel of various countries for their contributions to this cause .
if the first round of talks decided on the goal of denuclearization of the peninsula , then the significance of this round of talks was to hold substantial dialogues and to make a new step toward realizing the general goal of denuclearization .
during the talks , all the parties conducted in - depth and constructive discussions , explored methods and steps for resolving problems with wisdom and rationality , put forward valuable ideas , and made positive policy statements .
the talks achieved a series of useful results , and in particular reached consensus on the formation of a working group for the next round of talks , which is of great significance to promoting the process of peace talks .
dear colleagues , peace and development are the themes of our great era .
the people of the six countries you represent need peace , desire peace and love peace , and the people of all countries in the world want peace , love peace and love peace .
over the past three days , the international community has paid close attention to beijing and the diaoyutai , hoping for the talks .
some people may believe that the results of the talks are not great enough and that the process is not fast enough .
my view is that this round of talks started when the parties concerned lacked mutual trust and there was an increase in the gap between them in their positions .
the chinese government 's stand on the taiwan issue is consistent , that is , it adheres to the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , and one country , two systems . "
to this end , we have exerted every effort , displayed the greatest sincerity , and done a lot of work .
however , our efforts have met with provocation from the taiwan authorities and the " taiwan independence " forces .
we respect the democratic demands of the taiwan people , but we oppose the taiwan authorities and the " taiwan independence " forces engaging in " taiwan independence " activities in the name of democracy and separating taiwan from the motherland .
the reason why we have clearly demonstrated our determination and will to safeguard the reunification of the motherland is to maintain peace and stability in the taiwan strait region .
we have said that as long as there is hope on the front line , we will do our utmost to realize the reunification of the motherland by peaceful means .
we appreciate president bush 's reiteration of upholding the one - china stand and send a clear signal to the " taiwan independence " forces .
the leader of the taiwan authorities has claimed that " in order to prevent china from using force to encroach upon taiwan , he has unilaterally changed the status quo between the two sides of the strait and has to promote a referendum on the 320 peace . "
this is a slander of the mainland 's efforts for peace and a provocation to cross - strait relations .
at present , the real threat to taiwan 's security does not come from the mainland but from the " taiwan independence " separatist activities carried out vigorously by the taiwan authorities .
the " taiwan independence " separatist forces are the direct sources that undermine the status quo of cross - strait relations and endanger peace in the taiwan strait .
the taiwan authorities distorted the mainland 's opposition to " taiwan independence " separation and the maintenance of stability in the taiwan strait as an excuse for suppressing taiwan 's democracy and freedom and used this as a pretext for holding a referendum .
this is a sheer fabrication and a distortion of right and wrong , in order to gain sympathy and support for them in continuing to carry out their splittist line .
the leader of the taiwan authorities has declared that he will hold a so - called " defense - related referendum " and " peace referendum . " however , whatever it is packaged , such provocative acts can only provoke confrontation and hostility between the two sides of the strait , aggravate tension in cross - strait relations , and push cross - strait relations step by step to the brink of danger .
this runs completely against the mainstream public opinion of the taiwan compatriots in seeking peace , stability , and development , and is not deepening taiwan 's " democracy " but misleading and manipulating the taiwan people and seriously threatening peace and stability in the asia - pacific region . it is bound to meet with universal opposition from the compatriots on both sides of the strait and the international community .
taking a general look at the historical process of the development of the chinese nation , reunification has always been the mainstream and the trend of the times and the desire of the people .
as the motherland becomes stronger day by day , cross - strait cooperation has been strengthened , the international community has universally recognized the pattern of one china has been further consolidated , and any separatist conspiracy is doomed to failure .
the other two weeks or so is the lunar new year , which is one of the traditional festivals which the chinese people have attached great importance to .
on this busy and happy day , we are used to meet our loved ones , exchange gifts and express our appreciation .
in the spirit of ' linking people , delivering business ' , hongkong post works with china post to launch this ' mainland - hong kong gift fulfilment service ' to deliver their greetings and wishes to friends , relatives and customers living on the mainland or in hong kong during the lunar new year festival .
hongkong post has all along been working with other postal administrations to provide international fulfilment service .
as early as december 2002 , australia post and wine logistics service were launched to provide quality products to hong kong people .
this time , we are working with china post to extend our close co - operation in postal , postal remittance , express delivery and other services to cross - boundary logistics services . in response to the increasing market demand for gifts from hong kong people to their friends or customers in the mainland , this speedpost service is launched . "
the first batch of exquisite lunar new year gift sets , including festive candy , tea and dried seafood , have a wide choice of gifts .
it is a wonderful gift for friends , relatives and business partners in the mainland .
the contribution of the consumer council to consumer protection over the past three decades is obvious to all .
it would be best to assess the effectiveness of the consumer council 's work .
i agree with president chen that after 30 years , not only the consumers are aware of their own rights and interests , but all sectors of the community also attach importance to the rights and interests of consumers , which is the fruit of the efforts of the consumer council and the government .
the consumer council regularly conducts testing on the products and conducts market surveys and research on the operation of various products and services , and releases fair and objective market information to the public through the " choice " magazine .
the " selection " magazine is deeply trusted by the public . now that the " choice " magazine develops its internet version , it will play a more effective role in helping consumers obtain market information more easily .
the consumer council has 11 district consumer advisory centres and 16 telephone hotlines to provide information on goods and services to consumers and to receive complaints from consumers .
since its establishment , the number of enquiries received by the consumer council has increased from several thousand in the early 1970 s to 146,000 last year , an increase of more than 20 times , indicating that more and more consumers will make reference to the consumer council 's report and advice before choosing their products and services .
in addition , the consumer council handled more than 26,000 complaints this year .
the consumer council will also recommend individual shops with unscrupulous practices , which will not only help consumers beware of swindlers , but also serve as a deterrent to traders .
i told you that i watched television carefully before i made a lot of soul searching , seeing that the people of hong kong have aspirations and grievances and are dissatisfied with the government 's administration .
in this regard , the government and i have been making efforts to improve the situation in the past six to seven months and have seen that the people 's demands are to do a good job in economic and livelihood issues . we have also made a lot of efforts in this regard and we are aware that there are a lot of public opinions on article 23 of the basic law . we have withdrawn article 23 . in fact , the government has made an immediate response .
i have a clear understanding of the aspirations of the community for democracy .
however , i would like to tell you that what i am doing today is to ensure that everything goes smoothly after the beginning of the review of the political system , so we have to first resolve some fundamental issues , which are two different things .
what is the basic question ?
some are issues of principle , some of which are legal issues . how to understand the relevant regulations of the constitutional review of the basic law is to do a good job in this respect first .
we are in the process of doing this , and a three - member panel has begun to do this .
it will consult the central authorities and listen to your views in hong kong .
in today 's competitive business environment , brand name plays a key role in the success of our products .
to create name brands , it cannot be done overnight . it must possess creative design , fine quality , rich packaging , effective marketing and sustainable investment .
hong kong has the conditions to create a brand name .
we have knowledge , skills and experience , design , manufacturing , marketing , management , talent , and a vast market .
apart from the zero tariff preference on entry into the mainland market , the greatest benefit of the introduction of cbcom will be to prompt businessmen to think hard and strive to increase the added value of its products so that its products will become a brand that consumers in hong kong , the mainland , and the whole world love .
the election of the top ten hong kong brands held by chinese manufacturers coincides with cbc 's efforts to promote the development of hong kong products in the direction of high value - added growth .
in the past five years , the election has produced 51 " top ten brand names in hong kong " .
however , faced with the huge market on the mainland , the 51 brand names really cannot be counted . we need hundreds , thousand , and even more " hong kong brand names . "
over the years , the hong kong mtr corporation has actively participated in the mass transit railway projects in major cities on the mainland , bringing its rich experience in hong kong into the mainland market through service delivery .
i am very pleased that the mainland market has affirmed hong kong 's investment , professional services and managerial personnel .
this kind of exchanges between hong kong and shenzhen not only helps the development of the motherland , but also creates more development opportunities for hong kong businessmen , and provides more job opportunities for hong kong in addition to promoting the economy .
i would like to express my gratitude to the central people 's government and the shenzhen special economic zone for their support in policy areas .
this is particularly gratifying to both the people of hong kong and the compatriots in the mainland who have taken part in the development of the mainland 's domestic subway by investing in hong kong .
i would like to wish the early formal approval of the central government for the shenzhen - hong kong railway 4 , and the smooth implementation of the project , to lay a solid foundation for further exchanges and co - operation between shenzhen and hong kong .
today is the fifth day of the lunar new year , and i am delighted to be invited by the gold and silver trade fair to attend your spring festival greetings and officiate at the opening ceremony of the new year 's golden market .
first of all , i would like to wish you all a happy new year . i wish you good luck in the year of the monkey , the year of the dragon , the year of the monkey , the year of the dragon , the year of the horse of the monkey , the year of the monkey , the year of the horse of fortune , and the year of the monkey !
the surge in gold prices in the past year has recently exceeded the mark of us $ 400 an ounce , reflecting investors ' confidence in gold .
i believe that the business has been very busy over the past year .
indeed , the boom in the market was affected by external factors and reflected the achievements of the gold and silver trading industry over the past 90 years .
these efforts have not only laid a solid foundation for hong kong 's financial markets , but have also contributed significantly to the consolidation of hong kong 's position as an international financial centre .
the so - called " one - year plan is spring . " i hope that all trades in the gold and silver industries will continue to make efforts in the coming year and seize the " golden " time to grasp the reform of the mainland 's gold market , the demand for gold trade brought about by the country 's accession to the wto and even the development of the market .
i am sure that with the active efforts of the industry , hong kong 's gold market will be able to make great strides in the coming year .
last but not least , i wish the year of the monkey every success , prosperity and prosperity .
thank you .
however , the challenge of the past is not only to subvented public housing , but to the private sector .
the outbreak of the financial turmoil in 1997 and the collapse of the asset bubble , which had led to 70% of property prices being released , have been a serious blow to property owners as well as the worsening of deflation over the past five years .
now that the economy has turned for the better , we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure the sustained and steady development of the property market .
a healthy property market is of utmost importance to hong kong 's continued economic recovery .
we are also committed to protecting and improving our living environment .
our work in the years to come , on the basis of the principle of sustainable development , will adopt better urban design to protect our natural landscape and heritage and improve our living environment .
we will pay extra attention to the overall environmental problems .
the lessons of the sars outbreak in hong kong last year reminded us of the need to create a more spacious , clean , healthy and hygienic living environment .
we have stepped up efforts to beautify the environment , plant more trees and build more parks and recreational facilities for the enjoyment of the public .
i would like to thank members for their views on the part of the chief executive 's policy address on the administration of justice and the law , political system , civil servants and staff of subvented organisations and security .
the honourable margaret ng and the hon jasper tsang yok - sing are the chairmen and vice - chairmen of the panel on administration of justice and legal services of the legislative council .
the chief executive has put forward in his policy address a number of initiatives to promote the governance of hong kong , including strengthening ties between principal officials and the community , conducting more public policy studies , strengthening cooperation between the government and the legislative council , and conducting a serious and serious political review .
the department of justice will fully participate in the above tasks and strive to ensure that all government measures are consistent with the law and procedures , particularly with the basic law , including the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of hong kong people , and that hong kong 's rule of law and judicial independence will be maintained as stated by the hon margaret ng .
as principal officials , i will try my best to understand the views of the community and the legal profession on issues affecting the judiciary and the legal profession .
for example , the closer economic partnership arrangement between the mainland and hong kong is the result of the close cooperation between the government and the industry , including the bar association , the law society , and the association of notaries public in china .
we have successfully included ' legal services ' in the cepa as one of the mainland 's open services sectors , and this has provided a new platform for strengthening co - operation in legal services between the two places , bringing macro and long - term benefits to the legal services of the two places .
the task of the task force is two - way and we will reflect to the central authorities the work of listening to public opinions in hong kong .
since mid - january this year , we have met with more than 10 organisations and individuals .
everyone fully accepts that hong kong 's constitutional development should conform to " one country , two systems " and that the hong kong sar is under the direct jurisdiction of the central government .
most of them consider that hong kong 's political system needs to be improved , but at the same time , they accept that any development must accord with the basic law .
organisations and individuals also have their views on individual issues of procedures and laws .
these views and comments will be turned to the central authorities by the task force .
in the coming month or so , the task force will continue to meet with other organisations and individuals , and we will relay the views received to the central authorities one after another .
this is the first meeting between the task force and relevant departments of the central authorities and we need to continue our work and communication with the central authorities in future .
as you all know , constitutional development involves the relationship between the central authorities and the hksar , and the central authorities have examined the constitutional authority and responsibility of the hksar 's constitutional development , and we need to fully discuss with the central authorities .
the wkcd is a major arts and cultural project that hong kong has never undertaken before and is not only a project to provide cultural , arts and leisure space for the public , but also a project to improve the quality of the public and the city .
the construction of the west kowloon cultural district belongs to the entire hong kong community .
the government must continue to explore in depth with various sectors of the community and draw on collective wisdom .
we understand that we should not just pursue the beauty of buildings , but should also enable them to achieve economic benefits , sustain development and upgrade the quality of life of our people .
therefore , the government attaches great importance to the software support for the west kowloon cultural district ( wkcd ) , which must be in line with the relevant measures , including the management policy for the wkcd , the promotion strategy for arts and cultural programmes , the contents of the exhibition and the publicity strategy , etc.
in formulating these related strategies , we must listen carefully to the opinions of users .
our young generation - - including each and every young friend you are sitting - - will be one of the most important users of the future west kowloon cultural district .
we hope that all young people in the region , whether they are hong kong residents or tourists , whether they are mature or vibrant , will never forget them .
i understand that you have held discussions this morning on various aspects of the west kowloon cultural district ( wkcd ) and some students have spent more time producing thematic reports over the past month and i am sure you are familiar with the details of the project .
i am eager to listen to the results of your discussions and exchange views with you .
since the september 11 terrorist attacks , the global attention has been focused on security at ports , airports and borders .
as the world 's largest container port to the united states , hong kong undoubtedly responded rapidly to the " port security initiative " put forward by the united states .
in addition , we believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist organisations is an effective means to curb terrorist activities .
the daily outflow of funds from the global financial system has made the law enforcement agencies concerned extremely worried about the proceeds of crime and money laundering .
as a major financial centre in asia , we believe that cutting off the funding of terrorists is probably the most effective way to fundamentally tackle the problem of terrorist financing .
at present , hong kong 's legislature is discussing various improvement measures to tighten the existing legislation against terrorist financing , and is actively working in line with international standards and situations , such as the new recommendations of the financial action task force on money laundering ( fatf ) .
we are also working on a better disclosure legislation for reporting suspicious transactions to the parties concerned .
" balance " is also the key to this work : effective investigative powers , protected by constitutional guarantees , individual privacy , and efficiency of the economic and financial systems are all factors that must be considered .
our control measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , fairness and efficiency .
as a matter of fact , hong kong 's services sector has a number of advantages .
hong kong 's professionals in professional and commercial services have a deep understanding of international and mainland business operations .
hong kong 's accounting , financial , legal , arbitration , and other professional services are the best partners for mainland enterprises in the process of moving toward internationalization and convergence with the world market .
as for our transport , construction , design and marketing services , management consultancy , information technology , conference and exhibition services , etc , it will help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland enterprises , and help enterprises and products formulate strategies to expand their market and improve their brand image .
services such as tourism , medical care , insurance , and so on will help promote the development of the relevant mainland markets and industries and improve the service standard .
the close co - operation between the services sectors of the two places will greatly enhance their respective advantages and help hong kong and the mainland face the opportunities and challenges brought about by economic globalization .
to promote the development of professional services in the mainland market , the financial secretary and i have just held substantial and valuable discussions with the relevant bureaux and executive authorities and representatives of various professional sectors in beijing last week on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other issues of concern to the professional sector .
i am pleased to see the signing of mutual recognition and co - operation agreements in the construction , structural engineering and insurance sectors , which represents an important step forward in the development of the mainland market .
through the meeting , hong kong 's professional bodies have also established closer ties with their mainland counterparts , laying a solid foundation for the next phase of friendly co - operation .
i believe that the overwhelming majority of hong kong people love the motherland and hong kong .
in fact , the economic , social , political , and cultural ties and relations between the mainland and hong kong have always been very close and closely related since the reversion .
on the economic front , we have seen that since the country started to promote the four modernizations more than 20 years ago , hong kong 's industries have had an opportunity to move westward and there is new room for development , which has already brought closer the relationship between hong kong society and the mainland .
in recent days , we have further opportunities to take part in the economic development of the mainland in a more positive and extensive way in various service trades in hong kong , thereby bringing about a closer relationship between hong kong and the mainland .
with regard to social development , we have seen a rapid development of our country in recent years .
the people of hong kong are very excited about beijing 's successful bid to host the 2008 olympic games .
a few months ago , hong kong people were also very excited about yang liwei 's visit to hong kong .
because we feel that the country can achieve this , everyone , every hong kong resident feels proud of it .
as far as i know , the legislative council started discussion with the government on the long - term district office issues of the legislative council as early as 10 years ago .
likewise , over the past decade or so , the government has been considering a long - term relocation plan .
i therefore understand that the government 's decision to defer the tamar development project , including the new legislative council building , will be disappointing to some members of the legislative council .
i understand that some members have been wronged by the fact that they have to continue to work in poor areas during this period .
however , as i have said to government colleagues who are equally affected by this decision , i hope we will all be able to understand the situation in the public interest and be more patient in the coming period .
i have explained to the executive committee of the legislative council earlier that having regard to the current financial position and the financial position since the outbreak of the sars last year , it is considered not the right time to proceed with the tamar project or the large - scale office building project .
the postponement of the new legislative council building at tamar will help reduce the government 's fiscal pressure over the next few years and is in the public interest and acceptable to the community .
the government will resume the construction of the new legislative council building at the tamar site when the public finances are improving .
the president and the premier are very concerned about hong kong and i understand that they and the central government will do their best to do a good job in this area .
therefore , good news will come one after another in the areas of tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , traffic rights , zero tariff for products , and service trades .
i also hope that with the economic recovery of hong kong , hong kong will be able to make even greater contributions to the development of the country .
in my meeting with premier wen jiabao , i would like to congratulate him on the remarkable achievements he has made under his leadership in the last very difficult year , and although you are still facing challenges in the future , i am confident that you have heard his work report .
premier wen also said to me that reviewing mr. deng xiaoping 's important expositions on " one country , two systems " 20 years ago is of great significance to comprehensively and accurately understanding the " one country , two systems " principle and will be conducive to the future constitutional development .
he also told me that he was confident that hong kong people would really be able to seize this opportunity to focus their efforts on economic development and livelihood .
i will later meet with the secretary of guangdong province , mr zhang dejiang , and the governor of the province , mr huang huahua , to explore with them how to further our cooperation on the existing basis and create a win - win situation .
the last point is that " hong kong people governing hong kong " , which is known to all recently , is to run hong kong with patriots as the main body .
a very clear standard for patriots is to respect the patriots of their own nation , sincerely support the people of hong kong who have resumed the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong , and refrain from doing anything that harms the country and hong kong . this is patriot , and it is necessary to run hong kong with these patriots as the main body .
i would like to reiterate that hong kong people as a whole are patriotic .
what we are talking about here is not ordinary citizens of hong kong but people who are involved in the management of hong kong 's public affairs and are senior officials of the executive , legislative , and judicial bodies .
when sworn in , they should express their support for the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china in accordance with the basic law and pledge their loyalty to the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china .
the above - mentioned principles and important considerations are , in fact , talking about hong kong 's long - term future , the formulation of a " joint statement " and the formulation of the basic law in the 1980s . this set of long - term principles and policies has remained unchanged and will not change . this is because the country has resumed its long - term policy of exercising sovereignty over hong kong . this is a national policy that will not change .
over the past several hundred years since the birth of the intellectual property system , especially since the industrial revolution , the birth of one major invention after another has epoch - making significance .
over the past 20 years , the intellectual property system has become a basic legal system and important policy means for various countries to promote technological innovation and has played an important role in invigorating the economy and enhancing their international competitiveness .
at present , with the rapid development of science , technology , and economic globalization , the creation , possession , and use of knowledge and intellectual resources and the quantity and quality of intellectual property have become an important foundation for various countries to participate in international competition .
therefore , international exchanges and cooperation for the protection of intellectual property is of great significance to the establishment of a fair and rational new international economic order and the promotion of world economic prosperity and development .
the chinese government attaches great importance to protecting intellectual property rights .
in the early stage of reform and opening up , china began to establish the intellectual property system . after more than 20 years of hard work , a relatively complete legal system for intellectual property rights has been formed , and a system for protecting intellectual property rights has been established in which judicial departments and administrative law enforcement are combined . china has done a lot of work in protecting intellectual property rights and has made important contributions to promoting scientific and technological progress and economic and social development .
as mankind enters the information society in the 21 st century , the revolution in science and technology will promote the development of social productive forces with an unprecedented , tremendous impetus .
further perfecting china 's intellectual property system and strengthening international exchanges and cooperation in ipr protection are required for china to open wider to the outside world in the new century , and are also needed for building a socialist modern country and achieving the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
we are willing to work together with other countries in the world to establish a fair and rational intellectual property system that is conducive to promoting scientific , technological , and economic development in various countries and to creating a fine environment for mankind to respect knowledge , advocate science , and protect intellectual property rights .
accelerating the establishment of a mechanism for organization building is the most important task facing the sco at present .
with the efforts of all parties concerned , the secretariat and the regional anti - terrorist organizations have made great progress in preparing for the construction .
we must make continued efforts to ensure that the secretariat will be formally activated this year and that a regional anti - terrorist agency will be set up at an early date .
as the host country of the sco secretariat , the chinese government has decided to provide the secretariat with free office space .
in the future , we will continue to provide great support for the smooth development of the secretariat .
deepening and expanding security cooperation has always been a focal point of the work of the shanghai cooperation organization .
we must never relax our vigilance , still less tolerate or indulge the " three forces " that seriously endanger the interests of the member states in this region .
we should make long - term and unremitting efforts to eradicate these evil forces and earnestly safeguard the tranquillity and stability of the region .
in order to cut off the sources of funds for the activities of the " three forces " and strike at the " three forces " more comprehensively and effectively , we should put the problem of drug trafficking on the agenda of security cooperation as soon as possible .
economic cooperation is an important foundation and priority of the shanghai cooperation organization .
education is the cornerstone of modern civilization .
to improve the quality of our nationals and increase our comprehensive national strength , we must make great efforts to develop education .
the influence of rural education is extensive , and it has a bearing on the overall situation of rural economic and social development .
since the beginning of reform and opening up , tremendous and profound changes have taken place in china 's urban and rural areas , which are inseparable from the development of education , especially rural education .
the practice of the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output in rural areas has greatly emancipated productive forces .
one of the fundamental reasons why the advanced and practical technologies of agriculture can be popularized on a large scale and township and town enterprises can break out of competition , and the surplus labor force in rural areas can be transferred to coastal areas and towns in large quantities . this is because there are hundreds of millions of rural labor forces that have received compulsory education as the foundation and support , and great achievements have been made in popularizing compulsory education in rural areas .
at present , china 's agriculture and rural economy are in a crucial stage of development . the development of high - quality , high - efficiency , ecological , and security agriculture , the expansion of industrialized agricultural operations , and the shift of surplus labor force in rural areas urgently require an all - round improvement of the quality of rural labor forces .
the rise of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world and the promotion of the comprehensive building of a comfortably well - off society have set still higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities and ideological and ethical qualities of the vast numbers of rural population .
without the all - round " nine universal " rural areas and the all - round improvement of the peasants ' quality , it will be very difficult to achieve a comfortably well - off standard of living .
we must fully understand the basic , leading , and across - the - board role of rural education in comprehensively building a comfortably well - off society .
the advisers and guests attending the seminar included senior leaders of famous transnational corporations , well - known economic experts and profound experts and scholars from around the world .
i am deeply impressed by the sincere co - operation spirit and positive and pragmatic attitude of the consultants .
giving full play to our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom is conducive not only to planning and promoting guangdong 's development but also to jointly promoting cooperation and development in all fields .
i have been looking forward to the arrival of the international advisory council on economic development in guangdong in 2003 and to hearing and understanding your insight into economic and social development in guangdong .
today , when we gather here , we share the same goal : strengthening cooperation and exchanges , expanding the space for development , adding vitality to guangdong 's economic and social development , and creating opportunities for your career development .
china 's accession to the wto indicates that china 's opening up to the outside world has entered a brand new stage , and we are participating in international competition on a larger scale , in a wider scope , and at a higher level .
guangdong is the province with the highest external economic degree of mainland china , and has already taken the lead in experiencing unprecedented development opportunities and severe challenges .
against such a general background , we must tightly seize the new opportunities , meet the new challenges , comprehensively enhance our international competitiveness , actively promote the process of modernization , strive to create a new situation in economic cooperation , and realize mutual complementarity , mutual benefit , long - term cooperation , and common development .
the people of guangdong are concentrating their energies on building a comfortably well - off society and speeding up modernization , and this will create more development opportunities and space for all our friends .
guangdong 's economy , which is full of vigor and vitality and has broad prospects , is advancing toward a new height with a strong posture .
a few days ago , the iraqi interim management committee signed an agreement with the us occupation authorities in baghdad , announcing a timetable for the transfer of power to iraq in a step - by - step manner and by june next year .
the agreement was reluctantly endorsed by the international community : although the eu foreign ministers ' meeting welcomed it , france felt that " the process was too slow " and un secretary general annan , while " encouraged " by the power transfer plan , said that the un role in iraq was " not yet ripe " and russia simply questioned the legality of the agreement .
the iraqi people turned a cold shoulder and the us media even held that " this is a major gamble . "
in short , people are mostly half - hearted and wait - and - see .
the international community has a lot of doubts and misgivings .
this is because people can see that returning to power in iraq is not a move that the united states is willing to accept . therefore , the transfer of power cannot be thorough and is bound to leave many hints .
first of all , the interim government , to be formed in may next year , will not be directly elected by the iraqi people , but will be elected by the " transitional national assembly " elected by the 18 provincial - level election committees .
this is difficult to avoid us control over the legality of the system .
second , the united states has announced that it will not withdraw its forces after the power handover , but instead will turn its original " military occupation " into " military existence . "
the us government announced on 18 november that it has decided to impose quota restrictions on three categories of textiles imported from china : knitting , chest garments , and parking .
at a time when china is making continuous efforts to expand sino - us economic and trade cooperation , the us government 's trade protectionism move cannot but cause deep regret .
as the economic globalization has developed to the present stage , it is extremely inappropriate for the united states to impose new restrictions on chinese textile imports .
first of all , such a move of abuse of the " quota " has restricted the implementation of the wto 's principle of free trade .
on the one hand , he talked in a high - sounding manner about " free trade . " on the other hand , he frequently released " quota " missiles and reerected trade barriers . does this appear to be too arbitrary and fair ?
second , the " limits " have restricted the good momentum of development of sino - us economic and trade relations .
since china and the united states reached agreement in 1999 on china 's accession to the wto , us exports to china have increased by an average of 15 percent a year .
us exports to china from january to september this year increased by 26.2 percent over the same period last year .
in the past two years , us textile raw materials and manufactured goods exports to china have increased by a big margin .
as a matter of fact , china today has become the fastest growing us export to all countries in the world .
there are many reasons why bush 's visit to britain was unable to achieve its purpose . the most important reason was that after the end of the cold war , the united states became the only superpower in the world , and did not keep other people 's eyes on it , and unilateralism has expanded .
the united states , without the authorization of the united nations , launched a war against iraq and disrespected the opinions of its main allies on major international issues , such as the reconstruction of iraq .
according to a recent opinion poll by the european commission , 68 percent of eu citizens think that the reason for the united states to launch a war in iraq is insufficient , and 53 percent believe that the united states poses a threat to world peace .
second , the united states emphasizes anti - terrorism by requiring its allies to provide funding but has no reason to address the issues they are concerned about .
as for the iraqi reconstruction project , the united states is dead at heart , and is unwilling to give a cup to its own companies instead of a major contract awarded for the first tender , while the united states has already decided on steel trade disputes and the world trade organization has imposed high tariffs , and britain 's business circles have expressed the hope that bush 's visit will yield any concessions , but in the end has not made a clear statement .
third , the united states puts its own values above all other countries and insists on carrying out democratic transformation and being criticized . some of its allies demand that the united states respect the culture and characteristics of the islamic countries and believe that one of the reasons for the united states being bogged down in the mire in iraq today is precisely the bitter fruit of its " disrespect " for it .
bush , however , will not change over to new ways because of widespread criticism and opposition . during his visit , he once again defended his iraq policy and emphasized that the us - british coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with violent incidents in iraq .
since bush 's visit to britain has not been realized , the situation in iraq will not develop as the white house hoped .
after six months of debate , the japanese self - defense forces ' advance team eventually headed for iraq by the end of 2003 .
this is the first time that japan has sent troops to an overseas battlefield since the end of world war ii .
it reflects japan 's will to become a political and military power , and also indicates that japan 's defense strategy has begun to change .
the reason why the self - defense force 's visit has attracted people 's attention is that it is not an isolated incident .
taking the opportunity of the afghan war , japan achieved a breakthrough in the self-defense forces going out of its country , adopted the " emergency legislation " on the korean peninsula issue , thus laying down a hint for the self-defense forces to use force or even launch preemptive strikes , and the koizumi cabinet recently adopted the " basic plan to support iraq 's reconstruction , " thereby paving the way for sending troops to iraq .
this step by step has finally broken through the restrictions of japan 's peace constitution and achieved the goal of sending troops overseas .
in addition , japan is also preparing to revise the " concept of basic defense forces " in 2004 in order to legalize and eternal sending of troops overseas , and plans to establish a non-temporary " standing force " abroad .
at the same time , the japanese cabinet meeting , using the so - called " dprk missile threat " as an excuse , made the decision to start deploying a missile defense system in early 2004 and introduced the us - made " standard - 3 " and " patriot - 3 " missiles to intercept missiles outside the atmosphere and return to the atmosphere , thus building a dual missile interception network .
it is not difficult to see that japan 's self-defense forces are developing in the direction of regular armed forces which are " both offensive and defensive " and the so - called " self-defense forces " which are exclusively engaged in defense will exist only in name .
the reason why japan 's action has attracted people 's attention is , first of all , because these military decisions have an impact on japan 's peace constitution .
after visiting the yasukuni shrine , koizumi was interviewed by a japanese reporter and defended his actions .
his arguments were self - contradictory and full of flaws .
asked why koizumi visited the shrine , koizumi replied : " japan 's peace and prosperity were achieved on the basis of those who were sacrificed in the war .
my purpose in visiting the shrine is to pray for peace and prosperity in japan . "
may i ask whether the so - called " war victims " of koizumi include class a war criminals of world war ii such as hideki tojo ?
can we say that japan 's realization of peace and prosperity after the war also has the basis of contributions from class a war criminals ?
a reporter asked why he chose to visit the yasukuni shrine on 1 january .
koizumi said that it was japan 's tradition to pay homage to the shrine on the first day of the new year , and many people went to the shrine on that day .
it is understandable that ordinary people mourned the loss of relatives and friends , and many family members clearly indicated that their visit to the yasukuni shrine was only to commemorate their relatives and friends and to resolutely oppose the worship of class - a war criminals at yasukuni shrine .
the chinese people are reasonable . we have consistently distinguished the japanese people from a small number of militarist elements and separated the ordinary people from rightwing elements . visiting the yasukuni shrine by ordinary people is not the crux of the historical issue .
unity is strength .
this is an irrefutable truth .
to achieve the grand objective of building a well - to - do society in an all - round way and fulfill the sacred cause of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation , we must unite with all forces that can be united .
the work of the patriotic united front and the work of the people 's political consultative conference in the new stage of the new century must take this as the fundamental starting point and base point .
we must further uphold and improve the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the cpc , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front , mobilize all positive factors to the most extensively and fully , and continually add new forces to the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
in the past year , the cppcc has firmly grasped the two main themes of unity and democracy and conscientiously performed its various functions . it has played an important role in promoting the comprehensive economic and social development of our country and in safeguarding the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .
in the new year , it is hoped that the cppcc will do a better job in political consultation , democratic supervision , and participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs closely around the central tasks of the party and the state , carry forward its fine tradition , give play to its advantages , conduct in - depth investigation and study , actively offer advice and suggestions , and make new and greater contributions to building a relatively well - off society in an all - round way .
from 4 to 6 january , the 12th summit of the south asian union for regional cooperation ( fry ) , which was postponed for a whole year , was held in islamabad . the meeting approved the " south asian free trade framework treaty , " the " south african union protocol additional to the convention on cracking down on terrorism , " the south asian social charter , and other documents , announcing that countries of the south african union will work for common development and cooperation in the economic , cultural , and antiterrorism fields .
during the south african union summit , the bilateral meeting between indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf attracted particular attention .
the handshake between musharraf and vajpayee at the last summit did not enable people to hold too much hopes for the development of bilateral relations .
two years later , as the two sides adopted a series of major measures , such as restoring normal diplomatic relations , building land - air communications , and achieving cease - fire in kashmir , indian - pakistani relations continued to ease up and finally achieved the highest - level meeting on the occasion of the south african union summit .
the two countries have made great progress in the process of improving bilateral relations , and cooperation in the south asian region is ushering in a new turning point .
although indian foreign minister singh said on 4 april that the meeting was a " courtesy " , people believed that the meeting means that indian - pakistani relations will continue to move toward a more positive and pragmatic direction .
the leaders of the two countries have realized that tension and confrontation do not conform to their own interests , but on the contrary have deprived their economic development opportunities one after another .
along with the further development of economic globalization , it has become a pressing task of the two governments to strengthen cooperation and revitalize the economy .
although the result of georgia 's presidential election on 4 april has not yet been officially announced , saakashvili , the candidate jointly nominated by the right - wing political parties and leader of the national movement party , is certain to win .
more than 95 percent of the electorate support saakashvili , the central election commission announced today .
the heads of state of some cis countries also sent congratulatory messages to this young politician .
in fact , saakashvili has already declared his victory as early as the evening of the election ended .
he called this a " victory of the people " and said georgia would take prompt action to open up a new future .
when interviewed by the media , many voters indicated that throwing the ballots to saakashvili means choosing " new hope . "
even former president shevardnadze , who was forced to resign , expressed support for this former political enemy and praised him for " having a young and vigorous spirit and received a good education . "
regarding saakashvili 's hope , people have also noticed that there has been no major change in the situation in georgia over the past two months since shevardnadze resigned .
it can be said that the newly elected president will still face old problems .
the past year has been an important and unusual year in the course of china 's development .
we have waged an arduous struggle against the sudden outbreak of sars and scored major victories at this stage , the economy of our country has maintained a good momentum of development , per capita gdp has exceeded $ 1,000 , crossing a new stage , the successful manned spaceflight of shenzhou v has made the dream of the chinese nation a reality , national unity , social progress , and further improvement of the people 's livelihood .
china 's achievements in various fields have caught the attention of the whole world . the people of the whole country have made tremendous efforts in this regard , displaying courage and strength in defying hardship and danger and in creating miracles .
looking forward to the new year , we are full of confidence and hope .
taking a general view of the domestic and international situations , we are in an important strategic opportunity period that we must firmly grasp and can greatly achieve .
we should persistently take deng xiaoping theory and the important thinking of the " three represents " as the guide , comprehensively implement the spirit of the 16th party congress and the third plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee , conscientiously implement the central authorities ' major guidelines and overall arrangements for this year 's work , and continue to push forward reform , opening up , and modernization .
in doing a good job in this year 's work , we must correctly grasp the situation ; while seeing favorable conditions and new opportunities , we must also be aware of unfavorable conditions and new challenges and enhance our sense of responsibility , urgency , and urgency .
the three - party talks on the iraq issue were held at the un headquarters in new york on the 19 th . un secretary general annan and representatives of the iraqi interim governing council and the us - british provisional management authority held discussions focusing on how the united nations should play its role in the reconstruction of iraq .
the three sides frankly exchanged views on iraq 's political , humanitarian , and security issues and the appointment of the un special representative in iraq .
when the us and britain are faced with the power transfer scheme in iraq being boycotted , it is naturally noteworthy whether or not the united nations will intervene in iraq 's reconstruction .
since the united states announced at the beginning of may last year that the main war in iraq has ended , the situation in iraq has remained turbulent , and attacks against the occupation have continued to break out one after another , with the result that the us - british coalition forces have caused numerous casualties and there have been no peace at all .
former iraqi president saddam was arrested on 13 december last year , but the united states ' joy has not been sustained , the security situation has not taken a turn for the better , and the resistance movement has plunged the occupation authorities into a predicament .
on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab countries unanimously demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops from iraq and the government in iraq so that the iraqi people can manage their own countries .
at the same time , the united states and britain are striving to rebuild the iraqi regime in accordance with their own will and gradually extricate themselves from the mire on this basis in " dignified " fashion .
for this reason , the way and process of handing over power have become the focal point of current iraq affairs .
the power handover plan put forward by the us - british administration and the iraqi provisional governing council in november last year was : the iraqi interim government formed before july 1 this year will be elected by the " transitional national congress . " however , representatives attending the conference will be selected and dispatched by the " provincial - level election committee . "
the shiite faction , which accounts for the majority of the iraqi population , stresses that direct universal suffrage should be held nationwide in order to truly assume power in iraq in a fair and equitable way .
us secretary of state powell 's recent visit to russia remains the focus of public opinion .
on the one hand , this is because the united states and russia play a pivotal role and their mutual relations will have a far - reaching impact on the world today .
more importantly , powell 's moscow visit has substantive contents and has relayed a clear signal : dark clouds have appeared in the sky of russian - us relations .
if these dark clouds were not dispersed in time , the prospects for relations between the two countries would become dim .
although the channels of dialogue between washington and moscow are very open , powell has decided to write an article to explain his stand in the influential russian newspaper , " interest reduction . "
in his article , powell pointed out : the united states is perplexed by a series of incidents in russia 's internal affairs and foreign affairs over the past few months .
he maintained that the russian regime has yet to fully accept the constraints of the law , and the key elements of a civil society , such as freedom of the press and development of political parties , are not solid enough .
russia 's policy in chechnya and its attitude toward neighboring countries of the commonwealth of independent states have made the united states even more worried .
as far as diplomats are concerned , making use of the mass media to make known to the public is the " last resort " in communicating information .
the original intention of the united states in choosing this option gives food for thought , and the russian side feels embarrassed and unhappy about this .
after entering the new century , economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge facing african countries .
the leaders of african countries have come to realize more and more clearly that africa should no longer miss this good opportunity and should rise up to seek countermeasures .
on 9 july 2002 , the african union was formally established and began to operate . since then , african countries on the one hand have actively carried out the " new partnership program for african development , " striven to develop the economy , and tried to extricate themselves from their unfavorable position in economic globalization as soon as possible ; on the other hand , they have exerted great efforts to resolve the major obstacles hindering the great cause of african rejuvenation - - armed conflicts - - - so as to create a united , peaceful , and stable environment .
at present , the overall situation in africa has become more relaxed , hot issues have noticeably lowered , and various countries have enhanced their sense of urgency to end armed conflicts .
with the energetic support of the united nations and the international community , influential regional organizations , regional powers , and noted politicians in africa have taken positive actions and intensified their efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate civil strife . some conflicts and turbulence which have lasted for many years have been basically brought under control .
these include the establishment of a national unity government in the congo ( kinshasa ) last june , the peaceful settlement of a coup crisis in sao paulo and sao paulo in july , the signing of a peace agreement between the liberian government and anti - government armed forces in acra in august , the key talks between the sudanese government and the south anti - government armed forces in september , the holding of peace talks in kenya in october , and the signing of a peace agreement between the burundi government and the burundi government .
of course , the current stable situation in africa is still rather weak , the fruits of peace still need to be consolidated , and some potential or practical armed conflicts remain to be solved .
at the same time , there is still a big gap between the economic growth rate of african countries and the developing countries in asia and other regions , and these are all unfavorable factors in africa 's development .
how the african countries can effectively deal with the challenge of economic globalization and realize their dream of rejuvenation requires the african people to make long - term and arduous efforts .
recently , epidemic outbreaks of high - pathogenic avian flu have occurred one after another in some parts of our country .
the party central committee and the state council attach great importance to this issue , rapidly made a series of major policy decisions , and explicitly put forward the guiding principles , policies , and measures for prevention and treatment work .
all relevant localities and departments have taken emergency actions and gone all out to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the arrangements of the cpc central committee and the state council .
at present , the work of preventing and controlling bird flu throughout the country is being carried out in a tense and orderly manner .
highly pathogenic avian flu is a type of animal epidemic that spreads fast and causes great harm . it seriously endangers livestock production and seriously endangers the health and safety of the masses .
effectively doing a good job in preventing and controlling the highly pathogenic avian flu has a bearing on the health and safety of the masses , on agricultural development and on increasing peasant incomes , on the overall situation of economic development and social stability . all localities and departments should , under the guidance of the important thinking of " three represents " and in accordance with the requirements of the " law of the people 's republic of china on animal disease prevention , " strengthen leadership , coordinate closely , rely on science , and strictly prevent and deal with the masses .
as the world 's largest debtor , the amount of us foreign debts is also increasing .
the total debts owed by foreign creditors amounted to 6.494 trillion u.s. dollars by the end of september , an increase of 2.2 percent over the previous year , the u.s. treasury department reported today .
on average , each american is in debt of over $ 20,000 .
coincidentally , a research report released by the international monetary fund this week sharply sounded the alarm for the ever - shaking financial foundation of the united states , pointing out that the continually breaking record in us foreign debts has reached a level threatening global financial stability .
statistics show that foreign private investors have controlled about 40 percent of the us government bonds .
this inevitably makes one think of the tricks president roosevelt took in the first half of the 20 th century : adopting a deficit policy to stimulate the economy , and resolving the problem of fiscal deficits through external debt .
this move indeed played an important role in stimulating " effective demand " to resolve urgent economic crisis .
however , people can see that many us administrations tend to regard this as a " panacea . "
however , since president reagan initiated a tax cut and expansion in the 1980 's , the united states ' financial deficit has gradually increased and has eventually become the biggest debtor nation .
the convening of the first round of the six - party talks is an important step in the process of peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula .
some common points that the various parties formed in this round of talks have laid the necessary foundation for the continued talks and further cleared up the objectives , approaches , and principles for resolving the korean peninsula nuclear issue .
over the past few months , all parties concerned have persisted in peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the peninsula through dialogue , and on the basis of the results of the first round of six - party talks , extensively conducted coordination and consultations at various levels , and made unremitting efforts to hold the second round of talks as soon as possible .
at the same time , the dprk and the united states have further demonstrated varying degrees of flexibility .
now major progress has been made in the preparatory work for the talks , and a good talk is popular support .
what achievements the second round of six - party talks can achieve and whether the peace talks can be maintained are of general concern to the parties concerned and the international community .
commenting on the issue , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman said : the goal of the six - party talks is to maintain and promote the process of a peaceful settlement of the issue through dialogue . we are willing to make joint efforts with all parties concerned in this regard .
china 's basic starting point is to maintain peace and stability on the korean peninsula and realize a non - nuclear peninsula .
the chinese side holds that so long as all parties concerned adhere to the sincerity of peace talks , respect each other , and hold consultations on an equal footing , they will be able to create favorable conditions for promoting the settlement of relevant issues .
in the late 1970 s , murray relations deteriorated and the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1981 .
us president reagan listed a long series of crimes for libyan leader qadhafi , such as accusing libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons , and engaging in foreign military intervention and terrorism .
from a battle of words to a fight between the two sides , the united states and libya launched two surgical strikes on the " prairie fire " and the " golden valley . "
since then , the united states has imposed economic sanctions against libya , struck political blows , contained diplomatic moves , and threatened the military .
qadhafi , under heavy pressure , did not yield .
right now , the warming - up of murray relations is entirely due to the deterrent effect of the iraq war , which seems to be biased .
as a matter of fact , qadhafi , with a unique character , has for many years been fighting the united states while at the same time he has always thrown an olive branch into the united states , but unfortunately he has not received any response .
after the iraq war ended , all sides in the middle east adjusted their strategies and regional forces and created an opportunity for the resumption of murray building .
as far as qadhafi is concerned , repairing relations with the united states can end sanctions , revitalize the economy , improve people 's livelihood , extricate itself from an isolated position , and merge into the international community .
it is beneficial to give up those things that have not yet been and cannot be found for the time being , and to exchange for a new environment of dense willow trees and bright flowers .
from 7 to 8 february , important political figures from europe and the united states and other regions in the world gathered in munich , germany , to attend the 40 th munich security policy conference .
the so - called " munich security policy conference " is an international security forum founded by unofficial personages in germany and funded by the german government . in recent years , especially after the " 9.11 " , people have increasingly attached importance to the forum , which is known as the " davos forum " in the field of security .
an important item on the agenda of this meeting is transatlantic relations .
the remarks made by the european and american political leaders at the meeting show that both sides are making every effort to cast off the shadow of the iraq war on bilateral relations and to return to the track of cooperation .
bertrham , director of the berlin institute for international and security affairs , said that this was a meeting for the restoration of european - american relations , and that both sides had the desire to get close again .
as far as eu - us relations are concerned , the new information that comes out of the meeting is that europe and the united states need to resume dialogue ; it needs to seriously consider the common tasks facing both sides , and to find the interests needed to fulfill these common tasks .
compared with last year 's meeting , the smell of gunpowder in this year 's meeting has disappeared and the stances of the two sides are getting closer .
although the " old europe " represented by france and germany still brokered in the mind of the united states in launching the iraq war , they said they would " look forward to the next . "
german foreign minister fischer said at the meeting : " although we have different views on the war , we must work together to ensure peace in the post - war iraq . we must look ahead to this .
although germany will not send troops to iraq , germany will not obstruct nato from playing a direct role in iraq , he added .
the united states , which has won the upper hand in the modern media field , monopolized a large portion of the right to speak of international news . the antennae of its media have long been spread all over the world and have simply reached an all - pervasive extent . why is it that it still has to spend a huge sum of money to set up a satellite television station specially covering 22 countries in the middle east ?
in the words of a responsible person of the " freedom 1 " television station , it is necessary to provide arab countries with a " comprehensive and just " news platform .
some analysts pointed out , however , that the " free no . 1 " policy will be a strategic weapon of the united states in carrying out public opinion infiltration , cultural intrusion , and suppression of plots against arab countries . it will be an important propaganda tool for the united states to pursue its policy of integrating the middle east with the islamic world .
as matters stand , the mission of " freedom no . 1 " is extraordinary , and there are three major choices : first , it spreads the " concept of freedom . "
the united states believes that islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the promotion of modern civilization in the west . the extremist religious forces in the middle east are a hotbed for international terrorism mainly characterized by anti-us forces . in order to effectively fight against terrorism , it is imperative to remold the islamic world and enable it to identify and accept the western value concepts , lifestyles , and political systems .
the united states is trying to instill its own ideology into the arab people through the imperatives of the " free no. 1 " program .
second , it will improve the image of the united states .
the united states practices unilateralism and acts perversely on its own in dealing with a series of international issues , thus forcing arab and islamic countries and their counterparts in the world to do what they want to do .
after the " 9.11 " incident , the contradictions between the united states , which has consistently been partial to israel , and the islamic world in the middle east have intensified .
without conclusive evidence and un authorization , the united states invaded and occupied iraq by force in the name of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and counter - terrorism , arousing strong resentment among muslim people .
pakistan and india held talks in islamabad from february 16 to 18 , with the hope for peace again rising on the south asian subcontinent .
officials of the two countries have decided on the agenda and model for future talks and established a mechanism for sustained dialogue . this marks the resumption of the process of dialogue between pakistan and india after being broken off for two years , which has laid a foundation for the two countries to gradually resolve all outstanding issues , including the kashmir dispute , and demonstrates the valuable sincerity of both sides for peace .
prior to the talks , although a series of goodwill moves taken by the two sides prior to the talks showed that the relations between the two countries were full of warmth , analysts still mostly held a cautious attitude toward the prospects for the peace process .
it is no wonder that looking back at the sudden ups and downs in the relations between pakistan and india in recent years , it seems that no one dare guarantee : today , the sunlight on the negotiating table will not turn into a lightning on the border tomorrow .
on the 18th , however , the smiling pakistani state secretary for foreign affairs , mohammad hohar ayub , read the two countries ' statement , which gave an impetus to the two countries ' optimistic feelings . this made the eyes of many people who had long been concerned about the situation in south asia brightened up .
first of all , the timetable set for the talks is highly operable . the two sides not only specified the specific time and topics for the talks but also set different levels of talks according to the degree of importance of the topics .
second , the two sides have drawn a lesson from the failure of the leaders of the two countries in conducting direct dialogue during the meeting in july 2001 , and adopted a " step - by - step " approach of dialogue to ensure that the talks will proceed from a low level and be fully prepared for high - level dialogue .
third , after experiencing several bilateral relations , the two countries unanimously agreed that war is not a good way to resolve disputes , and both sides should stay far away from war . this consensus has laid a foundation for the leaders of the two countries to reach an understanding that " pakistan and india will never go to war again . "
to comprehensively and accurately understand and implement the " one country , two systems " policy , we must integrate " one country " with " two systems , " " patriotism " with " love for hong kong , " integrate the respect for hong kong 's high degree of autonomy with the maintenance of state sovereignty , and integrate the maintenance of hong kong 's capitalism with the adherence to the socialist main body of the country .
only in this way will it be possible to safeguard the well - being of the hong kong compatriots in real earnest and to accord with the long - term interests of the country and the entire people .
since hong kong 's return to the motherland , the central government has unswervingly implemented the principle of " one country , two systems " and acted in strict accordance with the basic law .
the vast number of hong kong compatriots enjoy unprecedented democratic rights in their status as masters of the country .
with the vigorous support of the central government and the hinterland of the motherland , hong kong has overcome various risks and challenges such as the impact of the asian financial crisis and continued to maintain its status as an international financial , trade , and shipping center .
practice has proven that the principle of " one country , two systems " has great vitality .
the purpose of republishing comrade deng xiaoping 's speech 20 years ago has once again proclaimed to the world the firm determination of the central authorities to implement the principle of " one country , two systems , " and it is all the more to let people understand the principle of " one country , two systems " comprehensively and accurately and constantly push forward the great practice of " one country , two systems . "
the party central committee and the state council held a grand national science and technology award meeting here today .
president hu jintao presented awards to academician liu dongsheng and academician wang yongzhi , who won the 2003 top national science and technology prize .
the conference presented awards to scientists and technicians who won the national award for scientific and technological progress and the " chinese manned spaceflight project " and the 2003 national natural science award , the national technological invention award , and the national scientific and technological progress award .
on behalf of the party central committee and the state council , i would like to extend warm congratulations to all the award winners !
i would like to extend my sincere greetings and high respect to science and technology personnel on all fronts of the country !
for our country , the first 20 years of this century are an important strategic opportunity period that we must firmly grasp and achieve success .
we must concentrate our efforts on building a better - off society that benefits a higher - level population of over 1 billion people in an all - round way .
we must put the development of science and technology in a more important and prominent position by making the best use of this strategic opportunity period and striving to do something .
after the " 9.11 " incident , us president bush dished out a " preemptive " strategy in june 2002 , putting it into practice in us foreign relations , and launched the first " preemptive " war in iraq in march last year .
the idea of " preemptive " not only runs counter to the norms of international law with " mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity " as its core , but is also bound to give rise to the dangerous effect of following the example . a new turbulent situation will arise in the international order because of this .
at the beginning of the introduction of the " preemptive " theory , some us political leaders raised the following question : " what should other countries do if they follow the example one after another ? "
as a result , over the past two years , more and more countries claimed to be " preemptive " and more " preemptive " efforts have been made .
this is a new trend worthy of attention and study .
in the same month , australian prime minister howard stepped forward to express support for bush 's " preemptive " strategy .
he said that australia would adopt a " preemptive " strategy if terrorists were to attack australia , and would not hesitate to take military actions against surrounding countries .
he even proposed incorporating the principle of " preemptive strikes " into the un charter , saying that it is necessary to amend the un charter and give various countries the " preemptive " rights in order to strike at terrorists or countries that support terrorist activities .
in the northeast asian region , japan 's defense agency pointed out in its " defense white paper " published as early as july 1999 that japan could launch a " preemptive " strike on foreign bases before facing missile attacks or military invasion .
after the iraq war , the clamor in japan for a " preemptive " strategy was even more rampant .
recently , international opinion has commented on the current us africa policy .
the " foreign policy focus of the united states " published in january this year , entitled " prospects of africa 's policy in 2004 . the article holds that in the past year , the bush administration 's foreign policy has directly or indirectly exerted a negative impact on africa . in particular , due to the united states ' all - out concern over the war against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially the lack of skill for the united states to divide in iraq , it has already greatly scattered its concern about africa .
people still remember that in order to show concern for africa , the bush administration formulated the " president 's emergency plan for treating aids " in january last year and promised to provide africa with at least $ 3 - billion of funds each year .
in july last year , president bush visited senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda , and nigeria , promising to provide $ 15 - billion to african countries in aids prevention and treatment , and $ 100 - million to use against african terrorist activities , and announced the food emergency relief programs and educational assistance programs .
these aid programs were once welcomed by african countries and won praise internationally .
one year has passed , however , the concrete actions taken by the united states are delayed in implementing them .
africa is in urgent need of assistance .
after entering the new century , africa is facing various development challenges . in order to achieve the united nations ' " development goals for the century " formulated in 2000 , work hard to reduce hunger and poverty , promote health and education , africa set up an " african union " to coordinate all of the affairs of the continent , and formulated a " new partnership plan for african development " aimed at promoting the development of various countries . however , due to its weak economic foundation , development funds have always been very short .
the united nations has repeatedly called on developed countries to use 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product for official aid to the least developed countries .
however , official aid accounted for only 0.1 percent of the gross domestic product , far short of the united nations ' demand , and ranked last in the list of donor countries .
recently , european public opinion has been discussing whether the meeting of the " three magnates " -- german chancellor gerhard schroeder , french president jacques chirac , and british prime minister blair -- is gradually moving toward a mechanism .
the media called the " three magnates " of germany and britain the " new three troika " of the eu , and the relationship among the three countries is called the " new triangle . "
the " new triangle " is a new thing , and no matter which direction it will go and what angle it will observe , generally speaking , this " new triangle " seems to be favorable to europe 's integration process , and will help europe play an important role on the international stage as a pole in a multipolar world .
taking a general look at the history of europe over the past 100 years , a basic characteristic of the german - british triangular relationship is that britain and britain join hands , restrain , or resist germany .
the two world wars proved this .
during the cold war , east germany and west germany were muddled in china 's warsaw pact and nato .
after the end of the cold war , germany became stronger after reunification , and the pattern of forces in west europe was unbalanced . france became more suspicious , causing the " axis of germany " to go out of order for a time , bringing britain and britain closer again , and its intention was still to contain germany .
however , in recent years , with the reopening of the " germany - france axis " and the fierce collision between the world 's unipolar and multipolar concepts , inside the eu has been bogged down in a serious split on the iraq issue ;
the " old europe " represented by germany and france is completely contrary to the stand of the " new europe " represented by britain and poland on the iraq war issue .
this round of split happened to be the largest in history by the eu .
egyptian president hosni mubarak has criticized the adoption of a single reform model in arab countries in cairo , in an interview with xinhua , warning that such an attempt is just the opposite of what it wishes for the security and stability of the middle east .
he held that reform measures should be based on their own characteristics , act according to their capability , and the unitary reform model should neglect the cultural background , social customs , and religious characteristics of different countries .
at the same time , he pointed out that arab countries welcome foreign aid in the process of reform , but such efforts should be made to recognize the different national conditions and respect the wishes of various countries , so as to promote the political , economic , and cultural reforms of arab countries .
the egyptian leaders ' remarks represented the common view of arab countries .
at present , under the pressure of anti-terrorism , antiproliferation , and democratic reform , the middle east , as one of the hot spots in the world , is brewing new turbulence and will lead to new integration .
after going through two wars in afghanistan and iraq , how should iraq carry out political reconstruction , which was once considered one of the " axis of evil " by the united states ?
how will various political and social systems in the middle east change ?
this is not only a concern of the arab world and the international community , but also of interest to the united states and its western allies .
after meeting with visiting bahrain crown prince sahman in washington on 9 april , us secretary of state colin powell reiterated that the united states would pursue a " western - style democratic and capitalist program " in iraq and the middle east .
he also stressed : " we are considering what we can do and how we can institutionalize this . "
last year was a " cultural and educational year " designated by the international olympic committee .
the beijing organizing committee for the games took advantage of this opportunity to hold a series of educational activities to disseminate advanced culture and popularize olympic knowledge .
among them , the publication of the " reader on olympic knowledge for secondary school students " , mainly for young people , is a very important achievement .
the reader is both energetic and colorful . it mainly uses the method of telling stories to vividly introduce the knowledge of olympic sports and the essence of the olympic spirit . it is a good textbook that helps teenagers and students enhance their understanding of olympic sports and helps raise their enthusiasm for social participation in the olympics .
last year , the beijing organizing committee for the olympic games specially designed a class program with the logo for teenage students .
the concept of " green olympics " is to prepare for and host the olympics with such ideas of sustainable development as protecting the environment and protecting the ecological balance .
we hope that these class statements will standardize the conduct of young students as required by the class and gradually make them a qualified practitioner and promoter of the concept of " green olympics . "
education is one of the core contents of the olympic movement and also an important embodiment of the " olympics of humanity . "
the true purpose of the olympic games is to educate young people from a new angle and use a new method to promote the harmonious physical and mental development of young people , thereby contributing toward the establishment of a peaceful and beautiful world .
therefore , the combination of physical education and education has not only opened up a new vista for the development of education but also made the olympic games more educational .
the " green olympics " is one of the three major concepts for beijing to host the 2008 olympics .
the core contents are to greatly improve the environmental quality of the capital , create a beautiful environment for the olympic games , and build an ecological city .
to this end , it is necessary to extensively adopt environmental protection technology and means , promote environmental management , urban and rural greening and beautification , and the development of environmental protection industries on a large scale , constantly enhance the entire society 's awareness of environmental protection , and encourage the public to actively participate in various activities to improve the ecological environment .
doing a good job in implementing the " green olympics " is an important task for us to implement the idea of " people first " put forward by the third plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee , establish a comprehensive , coordinated , and sustainable scientific development concept , and promote the comprehensive , coordinated , and sustainable economic and social development of beijing municipality .
we must attach great importance to this issue .
to achieve the goal of the green olympics , beijing municipality has drawn up an " action plan for the olympic games " and a " ecological and environmental protection plan " on the basis of the " 10th five - year plan " and the " report on the bid to host the olympic games , " thus formulating new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .
it will be carried out in a planned and step - by - step way to comprehensively realize the goal of hosting the green olympics .
on 25 february , the us state department published the " 2003 country reports on human rights practices , " which once again criticized more than 190 countries and regions for their human rights conditions , saying that the human rights situation in many countries , including china , was not good enough to meet us standards , and that some other countries suffered retrogression in the key area of human rights .
of course , there are still countries with tremendous improvement in the human rights situation , such as afghanistan and iraq , but this is the " credit " to the us armed forces in overthrowing the former regime and " liberating " the two countries .
as for the human rights situation in the united states ?
as in previous years , the report was reluctant to talk about anything like gold .
on 1 march , the information office of the state council issued the " us human rights record in 2003 , " making up for the deficiencies in the us human rights report .
the article , based on a host of facts , introduces the human rights problems in the united states and the united states ' human rights violations against other countries .
the americans have a tradition of stressing honesty and trustworthiness and have the tradition of making mistakes .
as everyone knows , the story of george washington cutting the cherry tree when he was little is a vivid example .
now that the united states has become the sole superpower in the world , it does not speak the truth .
recently , reports by japan 's mainstream media on china 's economic development have changed quietly .
contrary to the " china threat theory " in the past , many reports in japan have begun to believe that china 's economic development has promoted the recovery of the japanese economy , and the vigorous demand for the chinese market has become an important driving force for japan 's economic development .
the us newsweek recently also carried an article saying that the rise of china is an opportunity and not a threat to other countries , especially neighboring countries .
the widely circulated " china threat theory " is being replaced by " china opportunity theory . "
the " china threat theory " maintains that china 's development will pose a threat to other countries , especially its neighbors .
however , this statement , which was meant to provoke , was not accepted by china 's neighbors .
former malaysian prime minister mahathir once said bluntly , " asian countries need not fear china 's growing military and economic strength because china has no tradition of conquering foreign countries . "
in a long - range plan published by the indian defense ministry , it also holds that china does not pose a military threat to india .
in the economic and trade field , governments and enterprises of all countries have regarded china as the best choice in expanding their markets . overseas investors with strategic insight have resolutely written down the " china opportunity theory " with their actions : of the world 's top 500 enterprises , over 400 have come to invest in china .
for several years in a row , china has ranked first in the world in attracting foreign capital .
gp is an important macroeconomic indicator of the world .
it is of utmost importance to maintain gay growth in the entire process of china 's modernization .
we must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth just one percentage point increase of the present level of gp in our country .
to a large extent , the great goal of building a comfortably well - off society and the realization of the third - step strategic objective of modernization have to depend on the sustained and rapid growth of gp .
however , we should also see that there are also shortcomings in gay standards .
for instance , it is not easy to accurately reflect the quality and structure of economic growth , it is not easy to reflect the social welfare level actually enjoyed by the people , nor can it accurately assess social distribution and social justice .
on the other hand , ginger is not the only one .
in our assessment of achievements , we should not merely look at the growth of gp ; we should also look at the reality of the material and cultural life of the masses , and see to it that the employment situation , social security , and even social justice , social order , social management , social harmony , and so on are all determined .
therefore , we must treat the existing gp accounting system with a scientific spirit , a scientific attitude , and a scientific ideological method , and put gasim in a position of overall economic and social development .
we should maintain a certain growth rate , yet we should not regard it too seriously , still less should we unilaterally and painstakingly pursue it .
since the un security council delegation visited six western african countries at the end of june last year , the overall situation in the region has undergone encouraging changes although there has been some time or so in some individual countries .
we are pleased to note that the sierra leone government is making positive progress in enhancing its military and police capabilities and in strengthening its control of diamonds and preparing for local government elections . the unmik is also gradually reducing its size according to its established plan .
what is equally gratifying is that with the deployment of the unmik , liberia is gradually shaking off the influence of protracted war and is beginning to embark on the road of recovery and reconstruction .
guinea bissau has made positive progress in its political process and has promised to hold legislative elections in march this year .
the peace process in cote d'ivoire has again taken a turn for the better after suffering a number of setbacks . all sides have promised to implement the " lee - na - malcolm agreement " and the " new army " 's declaration on returning to the government of national reconciliation . the security council is studying the issue of sending peacekeeping troops to cote d'ivoire .
we hope that the un security council will make a decision on this issue as soon as possible .
the secretariat , the west african economic community , and the parties concerned have also worked hard from the regional perspective to resolve cross - border issues such as small arms , mercenary troops , and children , and have achieved positive results .
when fully affirming the above progress , we should see that the overall situation in west africa is still fragile . in particular , due to geographical and historical reasons , various countries in this region maintain close ties and affect each other 's situation . turbulence in a country often affects neighboring countries or even the entire region .
therefore , just as the security council report recommended , the international community , including the security council , must adhere to a comprehensive and comprehensive strategy and make great efforts to resolve the cross - border issue . at the same time , it should actively assist relevant countries and regional and sub - regional organizations such as the african union and west africa economic zones to strengthen their ability to prevent and resolve conflicts .
we have a common understanding that children are the future of the world .
we have the obligation to create the best and most appropriate conditions for them to live and study so as to facilitate their growth , maturity and success .
it is regrettable , however , that tens of thousands of children are still harmed by armed conflicts in the contemporary world .
what they have experienced are turmoil and backwardness , and what they see is violence and sabotage , harm and abuse , and sorrow and helplessness .
therefore , it is an important duty of the international community to protect children from being harmed by armed conflicts .
all countries , especially the parties concerned in the conflicts , should make the greatest efforts in this regard .
we are pleased to see that in recent years the united nations has adopted a series of measures to promote the protection of children in armed conflicts , and have achieved positive results .
the security council successively adopted four resolutions , namely , 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) , and 1460 ( 2003 ) , providing an important framework for the work of protecting children .
the peacekeeping activities deployed by the united nations in some regions take the protection of children as an important task , including the appointment of child protection advisers . in the process of helping the countries to be stationed there to carry out plans for disarming , recovering , and returning to the society , special needs of the children were fully taken into consideration .
some peace agreements promoted or participated in by the united nations also include provisions on the protection of children .
national reconciliation is an important condition for the establishment of lasting peace and stability in the region after the conflict .
if the parties concerned cannot bury the old grudges after the conflict ended , it will be difficult to really consolidate the peace situation and the flames of the conflict may even be ignited again .
in many cases , the realization of national reconciliation after the conflicts requires the joint efforts of the parties concerned and , at the same time , also requires the support and assistance of the international community , especially the united nations .
over the years , the united nations has played a useful role in helping promote national reconciliation , and has accumulated a lot of experiences in this regard . in our opinion , to successfully help countries achieve national reconciliation after conflicts , the united nations must properly handle the following three major relationships :
it is necessary to take into consideration the relationship between short - term needs and long - term objectives .
national reconciliation usually takes a certain process , and it is very difficult to achieve it overnight .
there should be different focuses at different stages .
to promote national reconciliation , it is first necessary to let former combat personnel " bid farewell to weapons " and create a safe environment .
during this stage , it is very important to strive to enable former combat personnel to discharge their armed forces , resume their duties , and return to society .
we are pleased to see that the situation in bosnia - herzegovina has become increasingly stable , relations among various nationalities have further relaxed , initial results have been achieved in economic reconstruction , and the work of returning refugees has been basically completed , and relations with neighboring countries have been improving day by day .
the progress made in the peace process in bosnia - herzegovina has not come easily and is gratifying .
we wish to extend congratulations to the government and people of bosnia - herzegovina , and sincerely hope that all sides in bosnia - herzegovina will continue to make efforts to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and constantly push forward the peace process .
at the same time , we have also noticed that the state - level institutions and capacity building in bosnia - herzegovina still need to be further improved , and in particular , reforms in the judicial and police fields still face challenges .
we believe that it is appropriate for the high - ranking representatives to regard this as their priority in their work in the first half of this year , and we support the efforts of the bosnian government to actively coordinate with the work of the high - ranking representatives .
it is believed that with the help of the international community , the people of bosnia - herzegovina will continue to score new achievements in building their country , embark on the road of self - determination and development at an early date , and achieve the goal of merging themselves into europe .
the peace and stability of bosnia and herzegovina are of great significance for the realization of lasting peace and development in the region .
the chinese side has always been concerned about the development of the situation in bosnia - herzegovina , and will , together with the international community , continue to make its due contribution to helping bosnia - herzegovina achieve lasting peace and stability and economic development .
china appreciates the efforts made by the counter - terrorism commission to promote the implementation of resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) by various countries , to help strengthen the building of the capacity of developing countries for fighting against terrorism , and to support the committee in strengthening coordination and cooperation with relevant international , regional , and sub - regional organizations in the struggle against terrorism .
at the same time , we hope that the counter - terrorism committee will increase its efforts in providing anti - terrorism assistance and strive to meet the actual needs of developing countries .
at present , the issue of the anti - terrorism committee has aroused the concern of the vast number of member states .
after repeated consultations , the anti - terrorism committee submitted a formal report and distributed it as a security council document .
after more than two years of practice , the existing structure and mode of operation of the counter - terrorism committee have truly revealed shortcomings , such as too heavy a report burden on member states , too many meetings and documents , the need to improve the work results , and insufficient coordination among experts .
therefore , we fully support the necessary reforms of the counter - terrorism commission , and we agree with the package of proposals put forward in the report , such as the establishment of an anti - terrorism committee , and we hope to resolve the existing problems as soon as possible , particularly the issue of the heavy burden on the report of the member states .
i would like to stress here that revitalization and reform is a continuous process , no matter how reform is carried out , the committee on anti - terrorism should maintain policy guidance and guidance , and any policy decision should be made through consultation at the plenary session of the anti - terrorism committee .
in recent years , the issue of small arms has been closely followed by the international community .
this shows that all sides are increasingly aware of the harm caused by the excessive accumulation and illegal trafficking of small weapons to the stability of the regions and countries concerned , the post - war reconstruction of the country , and social development .
it is fortunate that the united nations has taken a series of effective actions to solve this problem .
in 2001 , the " protocol on guns " attached to the " un convention against transnational organized crime " and the " program of action " of the un small arms were successively reached .
this has provided a legal and policy basis for the proper resolution of the small arms issue , and has demonstrated the determination of the international community to crack down on the illegal trade of small arms .
in the past three years , the international community has made great progress in promoting the effective implementation of the " gun protocol " and the implementation of the " program of action . " in particular , the successful convening of the first annual meeting of the united nations in 2003 has provided new impetus for the continued comprehensive and effective implementation of the " program of action . "
the resolution no . 58 / 241 adopted by the current session of the general assembly decided to set up a working group to negotiate for the identification and tracing of an international document on the illegal use of small arms , which will undoubtedly further promote efforts by the international community to crack down on the illegal trade of small arms .
likewise , the security council has also paid increasingly great attention to the issue of small arms . it has held special deliberations several times and adopted the chairman 's statement and resolution .
moreover , when reviewing a series of issues on protecting civilians , women , and children in conflicts , the security council stressed the importance of dealing with the issue of small arms .
developing the economy and eliminating poverty are the basic premise for achieving sustainable development .
sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and all - round social progress .
without resolving the issue of survival , there will be no development , let alone sustainable development .
promoting economic development and working hard to eliminate poverty is the only way for developing countries to move toward sustainable development .
without solving the problem of poverty for the developing countries , the development of the developed countries can hardly sustain .
rational utilization of resources and protection of the environment are the inevitable demands of achieving sustainable development .
development is impossible to proceed at the cost of wasting resources and sacrificing the environment .
natural resources are not inexhaustible and inexhaustible , but the demand for the development of human society is steadily growing . if relations between the two sides are not properly handled , this will inevitably worsen the ecological environment and seriously threaten the survival and development of mankind .
only by following the path of a recycling economy based on the most effective use of resources and the protection of the environment can sustainable development be achieved .
achieving comprehensive social progress and improving the people 's living standards and quality is the ultimate goal of sustainable development .
the ninth apec informal leadership meeting was held on the bank of the huangpu river in shanghai a year ago , and the scene today is still alive .
today , we meet in the beautiful and beautiful los cz on the other side of the pacific ocean to discuss matters of vital importance concerning economic cooperation in the asia - pacific region .
i am very pleased to meet my old friend .
taking this opportunity , i would like to express my heartfelt thanks to president fox for his kind invitation and the mexican government 's careful arrangements .
in the past year , the trend of economic globalization has continued to develop , and science and technology progress with each passing day has brought new development opportunities to various countries .
at the same time , uncertain factors in global economic development have increased , and some countries and regions , including apec members , are facing new challenges in the course of economic development .
trade protectionism is gaining ground , and achieving free , fair , and just trade remains a long - term and arduous task .
the struggle against terrorism is arduous and complex , and non - traditional security factors have increased .
our world is still far from tranquil .
although the international community is still faced with all kinds of problems and may also encounter all kinds of unexpected problems in the future , the tide of the times of peace and development is irreversible , and the aspirations of the people of all countries for a happy life remain unchanged .
it is of great significance that development is the theme of this dialogue .
development is the foundation for the progress of human civilization and the key to resolving various contradictions and problems facing the world .
only by achieving global coordination , balance , and universal development will it be possible to achieve lasting world peace and stability .
we should explore this issue in a comprehensive and in - depth manner and work with concerted efforts to resolve it .
the accelerated development of the trend of economic globalization has become the most prominent characteristic of the world economy today .
driven by the trend of economic globalization , ties between various countries and regions have become increasingly close , markets have become more open , and the flow of capital , technology , and talent has become more extensive and rapid . all this has brought unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and promoting common development .
at the same time , the development trend of economic globalization has also brought serious challenges to the south - north gap . some developing countries are facing the danger of being further marginalized , increasing economic and financial risks , and serious transnational crime . all this has added to the urgency of carrying out international cooperation and jointly meeting challenges .
at this moment when opportunities and challenges coexist , we should seize the opportunities , meet the challenges , seek common ground while reserving differences , expand cooperation , and promote economic globalization in the direction of realizing common development and prosperity .
( international ) us flu spread to peak
xinhua news agency , los angeles , december 31 ( reporter yan liang ) the us centers for disease control and prevention said on the 31 st that the flu in the united states , which was rarely seen in more than 30 years , has reached its peak , and 45 of the 50 us states have seen a rather large - scale spread of flu , resulting in a rapid increase in the number of deaths caused by influenza .
according to statistics released by the center as of december 20 , the number of deaths caused by influenza in the united states has reached an all - time high of 7.8 percent for the same period .
at least 42 children died of influenza in the country , and cases of adult death are also on the rise , but it is not yet available for accurate statistics .
experts believe that there are two reasons for the serious spread of influenza in 2003 : one is that the flu virus is not a " panama - type " flu virus , which was prevalent in previous years , which has prevented effective vaccine from effectively preventing the virus ; the other is that last year , there was a surplus of flu vaccines in the united states , and the two major vaccine supplying companies reduced the output to 83 million vaccines this year , resulting in this year 's supply of vaccines .
although an average of 360,000 people in the united states die of influenza each year and 1.24 million people are hospitalized due to influenza , it is hardly anything that has led to a certain degree of social panic like this flu .
william thompson , an american pop expert , believes that influenza is the worst in the united states in nearly 30 years . moreover , it is even earlier than in previous years that influenza has spread in many schools and has been lined up in many places where flu vaccination has been given .
faced with such a grim situation , the us department of health activated an emergency handling center on 19 december and dispatched a medical expert group to various states .

in its annual report entitled " silicon valley : 2004 economic index , " a non-profit organization said that the unemployment rate in silicon valley from the second quarter of 2002 to the second quarter of 2003 dropped from 10 percent in the previous year to 5 percent .
the report said that the unemployment rate will continue to decline as high - tech industries gradually recover .
the challenge facing the development of the silicon valley today is that it requires a large number of highly trained high - tech workers to fill new jobs in the future .
the report said that among the various high - tech industries in silicon valley , the unemployment rate is the lowest , and the momentum of recovery is also the most obvious . the amount of risk investment attracted by the biotechnology industry in silicon valley in 2003 is the first time similar to the computer software industry .
the report holds that biotechnology industry will play an increasingly important role in the economic development of silicon valley .
the report also showed that the average salary for employees in silicon valley between the second quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003 fell for the third consecutive year , but the rate of decline has dropped from 6 percent in the previous year to 1.5 percent .
silicon valley is still a prosperous region in the united states . the average annual salary of the labor force in this region is 624,000 us dollars , 60 percent higher than the average level in the whole country .

so far we have not seen anything . "

xinhua news agency , beijing , january 22 ( reporter sun yubo ) it is estimated that china 's tourism industry 's international and domestic incomes will be 487.4 billion yuan in 2003 , a 12.4 percent decrease from the previous year , but its performance will be better than expected .

( international ) economists predict us dollar devaluation
xinhua news agency , davos , switzerland , january 23 ( reporters li jie , ding xigang ) - the 34 th annual meeting of the world economic forum currently held in davos , switzerland discussed the issue of the trend of depreciation of the us dollar on the 23 rd . some experts predict that the united states will be the biggest winner in the continued decline of the us dollar exchange rate .
most economists attending the meeting believe that us officials , including us secretary of the treasury john snow , seem to have given up the " strong dollar policy " pursued in recent years .
the low dollar will provide the united states with greater room for economic development and more jobs , which is clearly reflected in the manufacturing sector .
at the same time , the depreciation of the us dollar has made us products more competitive on the domestic and international markets , and this will help the united states fill its trade deficit .
however , experts believe that a weak dollar will also have an unfavorable impact on the united states .
first , the us stock market is likely to remain sluggish , the value of all kinds of investments will decrease , foreign investors will withdraw their funds because of worries that the dollar will fall further , and import commodities will become more expensive , which will eventually lead to a decline in the living standards of americans , and third , a drastic devaluation of the us dollar may trigger trade and financial turmoil .
however , the depreciation of the us dollar has dealt a more serious blow to europe , japan , and canada .
the european economy is facing the danger of an all - round decline as a result of the fall in the dollar 's foreign exchange rate .
china will accelerate the development of electronic products in the areas of automobile , medical , and other applications
xinhua news agency , beijing , january 26 ( reporter feng xiaofang ) china will speed up the development of various kinds of applied electronic products , such as automotive electronics , machine tool electronics , transportation electronics , and medical electronics , so as to expand the space for the development of the electronic information industry and satisfy the needs of various industries .
a relevant person in charge of the ministry of information industry said : to transform and upgrade traditional enterprises is one of the key tasks in popularizing the application of information technology .
promoting the application of information technology in all trades and professions and raising the market share of domestic products and equipment is necessary not only for transforming and upgrading traditional industries but also for bringing about rare development opportunities for the electronic information industry .
it has been learned that while expanding the space for the development of the electronic information industry and meeting the needs of various industries , it is also necessary to support the establishment of a public technological service capacity system and support research and development companies with actual strength in providing technological standards and testing environments to provide technical support and support for the application of information technology in key industries .
at the same time , develop technology service , management consulting , and system integration businesses ; support a number of service enterprises that provide systematic integration service , including application service providers , and promote the development of a new type of information service industry .

with regard to imports , japan 's total import volume in 2003 increased by 5 percent over the previous year due to increased demand for oil and natural gas and rising prices , reaching a record high of 44.32021 trillion yen .

xinhua news agency , guangzhou , january 26 ( chen jiwu , hu yanni ) - according to information from the guangdong industrial and commercial administration bureau , the actual number of private enterprises in guangdong exceeded that of state - owned and their holding enterprises for the first time in 2003 , and domestic enterprises were effectively readjusted .
according to statistics , as of the end of 2003 , there were a total of 690,000 various kinds of enterprises ( including domestic and private enterprises and foreign - invested enterprises ) in the province , an increase of 0.59 percent over the end of the previous year .
among the total , 3.16 million were domestic enterprises , down 16.4 percent from the end of last year , with registered capital of 11,902 billion yuan , up 0.9 percent , private enterprises increasing 32.23 million yuan , and registered capital of 452.8 billion yuan , up 24.9 percent and 33.8 percent respectively .

( international ) wto has referred the " bird subsidy " dispute to arbitration for settlement
xinhua news agency , geneva , january 26 ( reporter li jie ) the world trade organization announced on the 26th that the european union and seven other wto members have filed an appeal to the arbitration organization to impose sanctions on the united states for " bird subsidies " .
the appeal stems from the fact that the united states is unable to scrap the " byrd amendment " within the wto deadline .
the " byrd amendment " passed by the us congress in 2000 demanded that the us government give direct subsidies to those us companies whose interests were harmed in the antidumping and antisubsidy cases , instead of paying them to the us treasury .
this move of the united states has met with opposition from major trade partners , including the european union and japan .
the wto finally determined in january 2003 that the amendment was in violation of global trade rules and demanded that the united states repeal it by 27 december that year .
however , the united states has not enforced the wto 's decisions .
to this end , the european union , japan , canada , brazil , india , the republic of korea , mexico , and chile recently submitted applications to the wto asking for permission to levy additional tariffs on some products from the united states , which are equivalent to the amount of us government subsidies .
however , the united states subsequently questioned the extent of the sanctions and the legality of the complaint .
( hong kong , macao and taiwan ) hong kong spring festival retail business up 10%
xinhua news agency , hong kong , january 28 - according to the hong kong retail management association , retail sales in hong kong have been good during the lunar new year holidays . industry feedback shows that the average business volume has increased by 10 percent , and individual stores have increased by 20 to 30 percent .
yu peng , chairman of the hong kong retail management association , said a few days ago that the individual visit of mainland tourists to hong kong has brought along an atmosphere of consumption in hong kong . during the spring festival this year , the retail sales in hong kong are ideal . some industries such as jewellery and clothing have increased by 20 to 30 percent , and tourists from the mainland account for about 10 percent of the total business volume .
he said that the use of rmb cards in hong kong by mainland tourists has noticeably stimulated the spring festival market , with each signing account reaching 3,000 yuan on average and individual mainland tourists spending as much as 10,000 yuan .
last year , affected by sars , hong kong 's total retail sales declined by 4 percent .
mr yu estimated that with the recovery of the economy , there would be a median growth in the total retail business in hong kong this year , but prices of goods would also be under upward pressure due to higher costs .
he believed that hong kong 's deflation would improve this year .
denmark introduces new bill to limit immigrants
xinhua news agency , stockholm , january 28 , the danish government presented a new bill on restricting immigrants to the parliament on the 28 th .
under the bill , children born in denmark will no longer enjoy the right to automatically obtain the danish nationality .
the bill is the latest step taken by danish liberal party leader rasmussen since he became prime minister in november 2001 .
it is reported that the bill is likely to be passed by parliament because the liberal party has the support of the right - wing danish people 's party on the issue of immigration .
the bill requires all children born in denmark to apply for nationality , not nationality automatically , in the same way as other immigrants .
immigrants who have obtained nationality will be deprived of nationality for criminal charges that seriously endanger society .
in the past two years , the danish government has adopted a series of measures to limit the issuance of long - term resident permits and the entry of migrants into denmark .
the number of foreign asylum seekers in denmark dropped from 1,4347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
as a result , denmark 's reputation as a free and human rights country has been damaged .
singapore 's achievements cannot be taken as a matter of course .
even if science and technology are developed further , i do not believe that people can maintain an ideal environment for a higher standard of living and a better quality of life , employment for all the people , and a constant increase in wages without hard work , social discipline , and adjustment to change .
these beautiful things can never be realized naturally .
only when all people understand that they must attach importance to their collective interests , make difficult compromises and make necessary adjustments can they have a better future .
what will singapore do in one or two decades ?
we all hope to see the future , but it is hard to predict it .
many factors are not controlled by singapore .
the development of many things is determined by the development of the world situation .
we do n't know when problems will occur , often involving gas .
for instance , three singapore tourists traveled to hong kong , and as a result they were infected with the salts virus . this is beyond any prediction .
in less than a month after the spring festival , three extraordinarily serious safety incidents have occurred in china , killing dozens of people every time .
people are shocked by the high frequency of accidents and the heavy losses of lives .
several months ago , several hundred people were killed in a gas pipe well - drilling in chongqing , a gas explosion in several coal mines , and a frequent fatal traffic accident .
china has a vast territory and a dense population , and the probability of disasters occurring is greater than that in other countries . it will lead to the death of tens of people or even hundreds of people , and this is a reality that there is no alternative in objective conditions .
however , from the perspective of general knowledge , china 's death toll is still too high .
most of the disasters were fires , coal explosions , explosions at firecrackers plants , and passenger transportation accidents .
this shows at least two problems : one is that safety measures are the most weak , and the other is that people have not drawn lessons from previous tragedies , thus causing similar accidents to occur again and again .
while singapore 's economy was growing at a high speed in the past , serious fires have also occurred . the painful memory of those fires has remained profound , but it has also rapidly raised singapore 's awareness of safety in public places .
china is also in a period of rapid economic growth and great social transformation .
the accident in which foreign domestic helpers were working in hong kong occurred frequently . although the figure was not as high as the number , according to the relative safety environment of the domestic helper , the number of accidents arising from the fall of domestic helpers was far from being in line with the minimal work nature of the number of casualties .
according to the statistics , 99 female domestic helpers from january 1999 to june 2003 died after the accident .
behind these figures are broken families that cannot wait for their daughter and mother to come home one by one , and at the same time , it is also an inevitable misfortune that we must exert every effort to reduce the number of regrets to the minimum direction of endeavor .
since 1999 , 96 indonesian domestic helpers have lost their lives while working in singapore , with some of them falling to work on high - rise buildings , according to a statement issued by the indonesian embassy .
the indonesian government has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction over the fall of a female domestic helper , and has formulated new regulations to more strictly control the quality of local indonesian domestic helpers and to protect their safety , but the problem has yet to be resolved .
it cannot help feeling deeply puzzled by the fact that the number of women and domestic helpers who fell to work on construction sites is even higher than the number of casualties . this can not but cause people to think deeply about the background and cause of the accident .
chen kong - li , a well - known expert on the taiwan issue on the chinese mainland at home and abroad , recently published a new book entitled " observe taiwan . "
most of the articles in the book have been written after taiwan 's first change of political parties in march 2000 . by the time chen shui - bian put forward the theory of " one country , two systems , " the author observed and considered taiwan 's domestic situation and cross - strait relations during his " observation of his words and deeds . "
the articles written two years ago were published two years later . this shows that the mainland 's process of examining taiwan - related studies was very complicated and took a long time to go . this shows even more that the " observation of taiwan " was not easily come by .
for a long time , while observing and studying the taiwan issue , chen kong - li always sought truth from facts , sought truth from facts , was not restricted by any subjective pre - set political framework , and worked hard to explore zhuo 's profound insight .
this feature has impressed people even more deeply after reading this book .
since the early 1980s , the research on the taiwan issue has become an " epoch - making activity " on the mainland . various research institutes have appeared one after another . various kinds of scholars and experts have also displayed their talents .
overseas , people generally split the mainland 's taiwan research institutes into the northern and southern factions .
the stand of the northern faction is relatively close to the government , and its speeches are relatively hard - line . in the course of development of certain specific historical stages or major political events , it shows relatively more overbearing hawks ' color .
the taiwan research institute sent to the south is mainly distributed to areas south of the yangtze river , including shanghai and fujian .
junichiro koizumi , who " studied in london for two years , " has been exposed by the japanese media to have spoken too much .
the post of post of japan confirmed to the education office of the university of london that koizumi only attended a few courses in britain for nine months , and he did not get any degree either .
china 's large and medium - sized media vied with one another to report and download this scandal so that the broad masses of compatriots can express their joy .
indeed , the prime minister of a country has gone so far as to fabricate false academic qualifications to deceive the people of his country .
in particular , it is even more shameful that japan is situated in " imperialism . "
however , if we can change a perspective , perhaps we can see some positive significance from this scandal .
moreover , these positive things are precisely what we lack and we need to improve .
in recent years , we have always advocated " honesty , " " building a sunshine government , " respecting the public 's " right to know , " and enhancing the " transparency " of administration . however , facts are far from ideal .
think about this , the diploma of a state 's prime minister was " mixed with water " and was not that big event in the first place , but it was exposed by the media and was in hot pursuit and fierce attack .
what else can such a country not be " sunshine ? "
at the taiwan election publicity variety show , all major camps will use tourist buses to transport the masses to the venue . however , the recent situation is that the evening party of chen shui - bian and annette lu has clearly been much more cold - shouldered compared with the evening party of lien chan and james soong .
when taiwan president chen shui - bian [ ch'en shui - pien ] went to a certain place in the north not long ago to shout " freeze garlic ( election ) , " half of the people in taiwan went so far as to cry about face - saving .
if there is no accident , taiwan 's presidential election , as it enters the countdown countdown period , and judging from the poll results and signs of an underground check , can all be assumed that the chen - lu meeting will be defeated .
unless the circumstances of an even more vigorous explosion such as the pan - blue scandal of major division or greater embarrassment emerged , chen shui - bian , who won the big position under lee teng - hui 's creation , has proven that he could not win the people 's support effectively in the past four years , but instead let the green camp 's various roles and performances of black money and low taste continually bring shame in front of the people and weaken supporters ' confidence .
how should beijing look at the pan - blue forces that may form a new ruling party ?
first of all , we should understand that the pan - blue army , which may take power again , is no longer simply the dominance of the kuomintang , but the convergence of the blue army and the convergence of internal traditions with the local factions .
at present , close cooperation during the election period cannot be regarded as an inevitable relationship in the future .
if he is expected to win the election , he is bound to need considerable time for internal integration . the coming election of the legislative yuan at the end of this year will also make it very difficult for the lien - soong regime to make a major change in cross - strait relations .
unless it is aware that the improvement of cross - strait relations can add points to taiwan 's internal politics and be sure to make achievements in a short period of time , the most important thing is to let the people feel this achievement .
based on this background , beijing should temporarily postpone the move to promote reunification and allow lien and soong to consolidate the internal situation of the " traditional blue camp " leaders .
more than half a century has passed since the first nuclear explosion in new mexico by the united states in july 1945 and the attack on japan in august of the same year .
although the arms race between the two superpowers in the united states and the soviet union has caused the accumulation of nuclear weapons to collapse of the entire world , both sides unfortunately realized the danger of nuclear war and avoided pushing the button for nuclear war .
after the disintegration of the soviet union and the world entered the post - cold war era , the danger of a large - scale nuclear war has basically been eliminated .
at the same time , however , the danger of nuclear proliferation has increased instead of decreasing .
this proliferation phenomenon is reflected in two aspects .
first , proceeding from the objective of regional hegemony , confrontation with neighboring countries , safeguarding security , or pursuing blackmail , certain countries with considerable resources and strength strive to produce and possess nuclear weapons by various means .
the other is the collective organizations of some non - state countries , especially muslim extremist forces that harbor a strong hatred of the western world , and they are also doing everything possible to look for small nuclear weapons , at the expense of harming a large number of innocent people , and carrying out bloody terrorist activities against the west .
under such demand , intermediaries engaged in the transfer and sale and sale of nuclear weapons and related technology and the " black market of nuclear weapons " have emerged as the times require . moreover , the scale of such sales has increasingly expanded and has become an important component part of the current world nuclear proliferation .
as a descendant of the yan emperor of china in the hangzhou - jiahu region , the image of the countryside south of the chang jiang and the life of farmers in the old times remained in my memory today .
after returning to their homeland after other years , they found that in the green field along the shanghai - hangzhou expressway , there were only three floors of houses built by the peasants , but very few people were working on the ground .
this really surprised me . it is difficult for me to believe that such great changes will take place in my own land , which still has a deep affection for my people in a foreign country .
however , we cannot help feeling surprised and shocked when we saw on the internet some reports on on on - the - spot investigation of china 's rural conditions .
unexpectedly , the dark side that could not be imagined still exists in china 's rural areas , and the chinese peasants still led a life of humiliation and hardship .
after their on - the - spot interviews in the rural areas of anhui , henan , and hebei , chen guidi and his wife delivered a long report entitled " investigation of china 's rural areas . " they asked for lives for the peasants , which shocked the chinese society .
from the large number of facts that the peasants were corrupted by corrupt officials and suppressed and even killed innocent people , they came to the following conclusion : " when we approached the chinese peasants , we felt unprecedentedly shocked and hidden pain . we saw the unimaginable sin that you could not imagine , could not have imagined it , could not have the resistance , could not imagine it , could not have been silent , and could not imagine it . "
this really makes people feel weeping at the heart of their hearts .
malaysia 's prime minister abdullah al - abdullah al - abdullah al - abdullah al - abdullah al - salem announced his dissolution of the parliament wednesday and the general election will be held in the near future .
the election will be a significant event in his political career and will be of symbolic significance to malaysia 's political situation and its development trend , he said .
al - hussein , who took over the leadership from mahathir in november last year , has been in office for only four months .
in spite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold an early general election .
there are at least two meanings : first , abdullah expressed satisfaction with his four - month administration performance and full confidence in his intention to vote , and second , he hoped to consolidate his power base through this means so that he could walk out of the shadow of mahathir .
undoubtedly , the decision made by abdullah al - la reflects that he has made a comprehensive assessment of the domestic political situation .
malaysia 's current economic situation is good , and there is no question of being exploited by the opposition parties .
what is more , since duan took office , he has adopted some highly visibility measures in fighting corruption , including the arrest and prosecution of former land and cooperative development minister garakan [ name as transliterated ] on charges of corruption . this has also enabled the public to be optimistic about future anticorruption actions .
at the same time , he called for improved civil service efficiency , which is also an encouraging move .
since its birth , the eu 's growth and formalization has been strongly influenced by france 's politics and culture .
diplomatic efforts should be made to gain independence and autonomy , and the attitude and method of handling world affairs should be different from that of the united states . this is the direction of the eu 's foreign policy . from this we can clearly see the shadow of france .
it is precisely for this reason that the international community , including china , russia , and arab countries , hopes to see the rise of the eu and see a completely independent force in international exchanges .
it must be admitted that since the end of the 1980 s , the eu has indeed been working toward this direction in the diplomatic field .
in december 1992 , the heads of eu countries unanimously agreed at the macedonian summit that all eu member states would implement a unified foreign policy in order to speak to the outside world in the same language .
however , in handling the issue of bosnia - herzegovina , the so - called " unified foreign policy " was for the first time met with complete failure .
from the malstrich summit until today , eu diplomacy , which has lasted as long as 10 years , is lacking .
in particular , the eu 's foreign policy can not stand the test of major events .
the different stands adopted by the member states in the us - iraq war have not only proved this point , but also once again fully exposed the fatal political defects of the eu . that is , it is prone to be separated from other big powers and destroyed by each other .
on 24 february , president bush announced in the white house that he would support the constitutional amendment prohibiting the marriage of the same sex .
this is a marked change in his ambiguous attitude on this issue over the last few months , representing an important development of us politics in an election year .
this constitutional amendment banning marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the southern part of the newly founded republican headquarters , but also plays an extremely negative role in the united states . this is a heavy scale cultural dispute aimed at splitting the will of the people , which will undoubtedly aggravate the polarization of us politics and further separate the east and west sides of the strait dominated by the liberal faction .
as far as bush himself who repeatedly claimed that he was a " gang member " but not a " separatist " during the 2000 election was concerned , his words and deeds were obviously different .
in addition , the younger generation in the united states has become more and more open in their stand on homosexuality , and this move of bush will damage the long - term interests of the republican party even though it has yielded short - term results .
bush 's new " constitutional amendment " attack can be termed the " scorched strategy " of this year 's presidential election .
bush adopted this tactic because he became increasingly weak on the two important issues of " counter - terrorism " war and economic employment , but he had no choice but to open up a new battlefield on religious and cultural issues that split the will of the people at home .
so far the united states has remained cautious in this regard .
that is to say , since maintaining the status quo in the taiwan strait can satisfy the united states ' long - term strategic goal of containing the mainland , the united states should avoid political and military conflicts with china because of encouraging taiwan independence .
it can be imagined that the united states will completely eliminate the space for holding a referendum in taiwan in accordance with beijing 's demand , but it will take some early warning actions out of its own interests .
recently , us secretary of state powell took the initiative to reiterate the established policy toward taiwan and take the initiative to express the us stand of opposing taiwan independence .
this kind of attitude has been interpreted by the outside as the purpose of curbing and preventing chen shui - bian from becoming possessed by the devil .
some us think tank personages with an official background recently made some remarks , and the united states will dispatch a large number of spy ships to the taiwan strait to detect military developments there in the near future . all these indirectly show that the united states is very concerned about the situation in the taiwan strait .
from another angle , it shows that although the united states will not completely stop holding a referendum on taiwan in accordance with beijing 's demand , it is also worried about the uncertainty of the situation in the taiwan strait during this period .
in the end , any large - scale election with one - on - one will produce only one result . either chen shui - bian will be lucky to be reelected , or lien chan will enter taiwan 's presidential palace again .
what is worrying is that under the condition of asymmetrical information dissemination , people of all walks of life on the mainland seem not to be mentally prepared for a possible victory for chen shui - bian .
if the result of the election is not what it wishes , beijing will find itself in an unnecessary passive position again .
an arab proverb says : " the chaos in one day is more terrible than the high - level government in 1,000 years . "
is this what the northeast asian countries are worried about at present ?
i think the answer is probably affirmative .
in a recent study , a well - known research and development center , which is close to washington and funded by the us government , explored four policy options for dealing with the dprk nuclear crisis , that is , engagement , containment , economic sanctions , and preemptive attacks .
the focus of the survey is the attitude of countries in the region towards these strategies .
in addition , the survey also analyzed the threat posed by the dprk 's nuclear weapons program in light of the possibility of an attack on nuclear weapons by the dprk 's neighboring countries , the possible damage done , and their fear .
china and russia feel that the danger of north korea 's use of nuclear weapons is low or very low , while japan and south koreans believe that the threat is quite great .
all the countries in northeast asia agreed to maintain contacts with north korea .
japan for its part supports containment , and other countries also believe that the containment strategy is acceptable under certain circumstances .
singapore cares very much about its international ranking . in the beginning of a year , it has paid close attention to the list of various countries in europe and the united states released by european and american institutions .
it is natural that we are on the top of the list .
however , there are also quite a lot of worries .
most people in china feel that they pay too much attention to the loss of their ranking and take pride in their ranking .
therefore , people say that we should live in a healthier way and compete with the rest of the world .
as many people looked disdain at the ranking in the past , a wonderful phenomenon emerged : people no longer regard " the world 's number one " as good news but preferred to regard it as an embarrassing thing .
however , the situation has changed over the past one or two years .
we are doubtful about the country 's long - term competitiveness , and people in all trades and professions are also worried that their rice bowls can hardly be guaranteed .
with this doubt , we are no longer so casual when we talk about it .
international competition is intense , and too little water may result in others catching up with one another and , first of all , it is easy to become a sample backward .
on the surface , bush was quite polite toward cheney . at the republican governor 's meeting at the end of last month , bush pledged in all sincerity and seriousness that cheney was the vice president 's candidate .
but he also jokingly said that as in 2000 , he had already appointed cheney to look for his vice president .
cheney , who has all along kept a low - key watch on his capacity , recently made frequent appearances in the media , denying that he will be replaced .
but he has left himself down to the next stage .
he said that if he is healthy or thinks he is really tired after becoming the president , he will step down in the face of difficulties .
cheney , 63 , had four heart diseases .
recently it was widely rumored that the us military had in fact already surrounded the 9 / 11 black man austerone and had just matured just just like catching a turtle in a jams .
the presidential election was held on 2 november . it is said that the pentagon has arranged for the october capture of samara .
however , his night dream is too long . if orsa becomes a fishpond fish , there will be endless trouble in the future .
it seems that giuliano amato is a trump card for bush 's bid for a more secure vote .
democratic candidate kerry has been confirmed to challenge republican president bush in the 2004 us presidential election .
before the general election in november , they began to carry out " warm - up activities " such as advertising and campaign debates .
they will probably cross the three major topics of war , economics , and society to engage in verbal and written confrontation .
bush believes that wars are closely related to us national security , and sending troops to overthrow saddam and counter - terrorism is to ensure us security , so he keeps telling the people : " we are in war . "
kerry naturally will point out whether bush abuse wrong intelligence that iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction to launch a war against iraq .
speaking of the economy , kerry thinks that bush 's tax cut plan is beneficial to the rich and unable to create new job opportunities .
bush called kerry 's view : is n't the current us economic data growing up ?
social issues , for instance , bush opposes marriage with the same sex , abortion , and the death penalty , while kerry also opposes marriage with the same sex , while abortion and the death penalty .
how bush and kerry presented their respective views on these three major issues and persuaded the voters through advertisements , television , and speeches is a political show they will perform in the next eight months .
however , on the diplomatic front , kerry has more room to sell his skills .
according to information , those who choose to commit suicide are mostly young people aged between 15 and 19 , but many of them are young people aged 10 to 14 .
it is generally believed that academic pressure is the direct cause for children and youth to commit suicide , but studies have found that emotional problems , particularly love between men and women and problems between parents , are the main causes for local young people to find their own shortcomings .
the difference in academic pressure and expectations is of course also within the scope of communication between parents and children .
the pressure of further studies is an inevitable burden for the long term , and sometimes it is given to them by their parents and children in many times .
if parents want their children to have good results , they will take other children as a comparison . naturally , it will result in great pressure on their children to strive for higher heights . however , the channel of persuasion and communication behind the pressure is a way of measuring parent - child relations .
if the child 's performance is not ideal , his parents will condemn him or her in a silent manner , or even make the child feel disappointed , and undoubtedly push the child to an impasse of seeking help .
it is understood that many young students who need counselling are forced to enter the blind spot by excessively high expectations of their parents .
singapore 's success and rapid development have made parents feel that their children have much better material conditions than in the past . it is hard to avoid believing that their children should perform better than themselves .
usually , parents have forgotten that they are still their children , but actually their performance in various aspects may not be particularly outstanding .
when she was one and a half years old , the overwhelming majority of children were sent to the nursery of various institutions to practice a full care system , and the authorities only symbolic that they would charge a little child a week or even one month back home .
today , singapore is facing a social problem of a declining fertility rate and an ageing population .
in order to maintain a modern standard of living and to enjoy their leisure time , the younger generation has the energy to respond to the government 's call for early marriage and early child birth .
this writer has made a bold suggestion : the government should come forward to accept new - born children .
the people of our country only manage their lives , and there is no need to worry about breeding .
on the one hand , the government has set up a nursery school under a single care system and converted primary schools into whole - day schools , or even provided three meal services , thus symbolising the government 's efforts in collecting fees from citizens .
this will not only solve the employment problem of the unemployed population , but also reduce the cost of the government 's measures such as bonuses , maternity leave , quality of women and domestic helpers , and tax rebates .
what beijing needs to do is not only to play a leading role in the six - party talks but also to focus on china 's long - term interests on the korean peninsula , to prepare for a rainy day , and to start strategic deployment as soon as possible .
to put it more specifically , beijing on the one hand wants north korea to abandon its nuclear weapons . on the other hand , it starts from transforming the kim chong - il regime by guiding north korea on the road of modern civilization , lifting the danger of nuclear war in northeast asia , maintaining the status quo on the korean peninsula , and obtaining bargaining chips in long - term strategic dealings with the united states .
pyongyang is ferocious in appearance but weak inside , and in its heart it is eager to develop the economy and merge with the international community .
however , this kind of desire is often expressed in an external form that is inexcusable , irrational , and sometimes even totally inconsistent with international rules .
as a matter of fact , for some time now , beijing has used the means of influence and economic aid to force pyongyang to change its stand that is inconsistent with international rules .
but this operation still needs to be planned in an all - round way .
beijing 's aid to pyongyang should not be limited to the economic aspect , but should all the more be extended to other fields of society , and not limited to pyongyang 's giving up of its nuclear plan , it should all the more focus on the approach of introducing it to modern civilization .
kerry was not seen getting into the competition as soon as he started , and all the focal points were focused on former vermont governor dion .
however , in january , prior to the party caucus meeting in the state of virginia , kerry suddenly took off and won the party group meetings and primary elections in the two most critical states of apollo and new hampshire .
in the following state elections , kerry basically did not lose hands , and the states that lost the hands were all because that state had its own candidates .
kerry spent only six weeks turning from a candidate with almost no future to the final candidate , and all his competitors , including gephardt , lieberman , clark , di'an , and edwards , fell in succession . this has to make people look at kerry 's political charm .
during his 19 - year tenure as senator , kerry has always supported policies on abortion and environmental protection , opposed tax cuts for the benefit of the rich , worked hard to raise the minimum wage , and hoped to resolve the problem of global warming .
his work experience in washington has demonstrated his courage to face social problems squarely , challenge authority , pursue value , and defy the interests of a small number of people .
china 's reform and opening up policy began from agriculture , and the rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of this policy .
however , since the 1990 's , agricultural reform has basically stagnated due to the economic policy tilted toward the cities , and the gap between the cities and the countryside has become increasingly wide .
over a long period of time , china has already displayed two completely different worlds . one is a highly prosperous city , and the other is a poor and backward village .
in chinese officials ' minds , the widening of the gap between rich and poor in china 's urban and rural areas is a " question of development , " so it is still necessary to resolve it through sustained development .
in other words , china 's coastal areas and cities should continue to develop , and should not be dragged down by the rural problems .
however , when people see that some big cities can undergo minor changes a year and undergo major changes in three years , they will ask : why have some poor areas not changed in the past few decades ?
of course , the development path of the urban and rural areas is very different . this is a fact that should be recognized . however , the question is whether the rural population , which accounts for 70 percent of the country 's total population , has also received concern and attention when a large amount of funds have been invested in urban construction and given encouragement and support to the affluent middle class ?
theoretically , all previous chinese governments have paid close attention to issues related to agriculture , the rural areas , and the peasants .
however , over the past few years , the situation in rural areas has become increasingly difficult and worsened . this shows that the degree of attention given to the problem has become less and less serious .
in any country , public security , procuratorial , and law should be a symbol of justice and justice , and should also be the most important system for safeguarding social stability .
unfortunately , public security , procuratorial , and judicial organs have become a symbol of corruption in china .
the national audit office recently reported that the results of the examination of the financial expenditures of public security organs in 26 provinces and municipalities last year showed that the amount of illegal funds paid by public security organs across the country reached 16.5 billion yuan .
the confidence crisis in public security , procuratorial , and law has become open .
both the liu yong incident and sun zhigang incident and the recent " bmw " incident in heilongjiang have reflected such profound distrust .
the " bmw " incident is even more typical .
people 's concern over this problem even far exceeded their attention to sars during the sars period .
as a matter of fact , people 's concern is no longer that of the " bmw " incident itself but has expressed their distrust of the entire judicial system .
the departments concerned are very clear about this , so they have taken measures to block the media from doing so not long ago .
however , the problem is still there .
the second round of six - party talks on the korean peninsula nuclear issue ended in a widely expected result .
during this round of talks , all parties concerned conducted contacts and explorations on the peripheral issues of the nuclear crisis on the peninsula and reached consensus on holding the third round of talks and setting up a working group before the end of june this year .
however , the talks not only did not make any progress , but also gave people a feeling that the dprk should give up its nuclear weapons development plan and that the united states should ensure its political and military security after north korea renounces its nuclear program .
neither the dprk nor the united states has shown any concessions . neither has the basic stand of the two sides relaxed .
however , what attracted people 's attention was that during this round of talks , the united states showed an attitude of not rushing to solve problems and gave people the impression of " dragging on " .
this strategy demonstrated by the united states is closely related to the new development of the current international situation and to the interests it has gained in these new developments .
since roosevelt became president , the united states has never put so many company bosses in jail .
is this a coincidence , or has the public and investors endured the crime of a company and other illegal acts over the past three years , and this has caused the crime to be exposed most recently ?
the answer may not be simple , but it is a fact that many companies have recently been exposed of criminal activities .
this is a good beginning for the economic recovery , especially for restoring investment confidence .
at the end of the 1990s , it may be one of the most chaotic and difficult stages in us commercial history , and the earlier its influence is lost , the better .
the dust has settled , and the names of some companies are bound to fade away from history , and in the end they can only be found in the textbooks of the school of business .
some other companies , such as taike and mai po , will , under the leadership of their new management team , strive to restructure themselves in order to greet a new round of economic growth .
when will a new round of economic growth come ?
as cmec , you may not have any answer .
it is not necessary to do this because us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan does not know the answer .
the bush administration wants to stimulate the economy by means of idiot . on the one hand , it wants to greatly increase spending ( particularly national defense expenditures ) , and on the other hand , it wants to reduce taxes by a large margin .
internationally , the bush administration continues to promote free trade , but the trade deficit has reached a record high of $ 549 billion .
after the big tax cut , there was no marked increase in investment and consumption .
the new keyley , represented by the famous british economist gao dezhan , believes the us economy is already in a difficult position and bush 's financial and economic strategies are lacking in skill .
they believe that the so - called " putting the market law in command " is only an illusion and will inevitably bring benefits to a small number of people and suffer losses from the majority .
people have been of the view that , on a global scale , the so - called minority of profits are all in the united states , and the majority of the people who suffer losses are in developing countries .
this is not the case at present .
many people in the us economic and academic circles believe that apart from the multinational companies based on the united states , india and china are also in a prominent position in the process of globalization .
india occupies the service sector of the economy , while china occupies the sphere of manufacturing .
people have concentrated their energies on the transfer of large quantities of us capital and production equipment to china , but they have failed to see the advantages of china 's high - level and low - income labor market .
first of all , the current situation in taiwan is expected to be outside beijing 's estimation .
how beijing estimates it , only its own clear , but the estimated results can be considered by the people around the world from the open phenomena .
over the past four years , the pro-independence camp of chen shui - bian and annette lu has spoken clear - cut and acted diligently , and the taiwan independence movement has made positive progress .
in contrast , beijing , apart from her spouses , has a moderate attitude of being close to routine , and seems indifferent toward the progress of taiwan independence .
however , since the autumn of last year , it has become totally different . it seems that the cow car has changed into a cattle vehicle , which can be seen in the past few months , and its handling capacity is quite different from that of the 1990 's .
from this we can conclude that taiwan 's current situation is within its estimation .
second , it is necessary to look at foreign affairs related to taiwan .
on the development of the situation in the taiwan strait , it depends on whether or not the attitude of the united states and other major countries is closer to beijing or taipei .
as the attitude of various countries can be seen publicly , the answer is very clear .
up to now , not only have countries and beijing become relatively close , but they have a lot of concrete common ground . they have become rather distant from taipei and do not share much specific feelings with it , but they have also started to give advice on democracy in taiwan , which has been praised all along .
