princess of bahrain dies five years after marriage
princess meles harriet harriet of bahrain married american marines johnson , who had won widespread praise from us television stations . however , this troubled marriage lasted for five years , but it has now come to a close in las vegas .
meili , a member of the royal family of bahrain in the gulf country , once became the main theme of a tv film , where johnson took the risk of losing his military life to participate in this forbidden love song .
however , according to a commentary in las vegas , it took five years for the two to appeal to the court for a divorce , where they were getting married quickly .
they met in 1999 when johnson was still a professional soldier stationed in bahrain .
after learning about this vivacious little princess , the sparks of love between the two have given rise to tremendous changes in his life .
the royal family banned the combination of these little lovers and gave birth to mei li'an , allowed her to wear velvet shirts , wear a baseball cap , and secretly bring her out of the motherland and to the united states according to military documents .
after a tough immigration lawsuit with the us authorities , the young couple finally married in the candle light church on the magnificent las vegas avenue when johnson , 23 , the new girl was only 19 .
johnson , however , said that because las vegas , known as the " sin city " , had lured him and merlian 's parents , who had strong financial strength , had always been tense and had been spreading rumors about a plot to assassinate him . this troubled marriage finally could not survive .
johnson said that he relied on guests of hotels and casinos to park their life while melancholia gradually caught in the night of the gambling town and frequently went up to the night shop to keep her husband out of sight .
mei li'an left the office one year ago .
johnson said , " she is alive . "
euro zone economic indicators to show continued weak economy in europe
economists said that the euro zone economic indicators to be released this week will show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing down in economic output , while britain 's data is expected to show an increase in industrial activity .
they said the economic output data of the biggest country in the euro zone would continue to show great fluctuations every month , but the long - term trend of economic output would show a slowdown .
the most important economic indicators for this week will provide evidence of european economic confidence in the first economic indicators to be released on the 7 th in germany and the market .
the pmug index dropped sharply from 31.3 in the previous month to 13.9 in november .
economists said that the substantial appreciation of the euro would continue to affect economic confidence in recent surveys , so there is no reason to predict a rebound in economic expectations .
economists of the nba said : " considering the main factors leading to the decline in economic confidence , including the appreciation of the euro , uncertain factors in the global economy , and unemployment rate which has worsened the german job market , all have a bearing on the anticipated future growth in december . therefore , it is not possible for the index to rebound strongly . "
according to a survey conducted by afp 's financial news dax to economists , this index will fall again from 11.9 percent in the previous month to 11 percent in december .
however , the target for the development of the industry is likely to fall to zero by december , the governor of the pbma said .
" the future of economic activities in germany , according to our view , will continue to decrease as reflected by the investigation of analysts and participants in the financial market , " tize said .
tension in ukraine due to crisis
russia has accused the west of interfering in east european affairs on numerous occasions because ukraine 's political crisis is getting the focus of attention and the annual meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) is set to be the main agenda .
western forces are gradually extending their sphere of influence to europe , which has been viewed by russia as their backyard . for example , the baltic countries , georgia and central asia have long been quite dissatisfied with russia . therefore , when osce is holding its two - day meeting in sofia , the capital city of bulgaria , its recent events may become an important topic of discussion .
the supreme court of ukraine made a dramatic ruling asking for a second round of voting in the recent presidential election . before that , the european union had called on members of the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) to prepare for " the fastest and efficient action " for observers .
the number of observers sent by the osce may increase from 600 to 1,000 in ukraine 's december 26 recount , european sources said .
us secretary of state colin powell will attend the osce annual meeting , which may be his last foreign visit before leaving office .
russian foreign minister lavrov , french foreign minister barnier , british foreign minister straw , and german foreign minister fischer will also attend .
osce members include 55 countries in north america , europe and asia , and will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its founding next year .
the organization was founded in helsinki that year and has contributed to the end of the cold war .
bush 's intelligence reform bill faces congress vote this week
the intelligence reform bill , to be passed this week by the us congress with all efforts , is an ambitious administrative plan pushed by republican president bush for the second term , and his support among republican lawmakers is facing a major test for the first time since he was reelected .
keane , former republican governor of new jersey , who was responsible for investigating the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the issue of the intelligence reform act was passed by congress , and that alone this incident had bad intentions on future cooperation between the two parties and on domestic policies of the president .
keane said : " if the president and congress fail to properly handle these major issues , the congress will become less functional and we will have trouble . "
he told the daily news in new york : " we have been waiting for a long time to have another bill that will win the support of republican and democratic leaders in both the senate and the house of representatives , as well as 80 percent of public support . "
several congressmen said yesterday that if the historic reform bill fails , it will delay thorough overhaul of the us old spy network system for several months , even several years , or even completely harm its existence .
al - haman , democratic member of the house intelligence committee , said on cnn yesterday , " it will die in placenta if the bill fails to be passed this week . "
congress will try to pass the " 2005 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention and control act " again on the 6th and 7th of next year , and then adjourned until early next year .
if the bill fails to be passed , it will become invalid and will not be redrafted until 2005 .
ukrainian opposition rejects revision of constitution
ukraine 's pro - western opposition parties insisted today that they would not accept a constitutional reform initiated by outgoing president kuchema before a second round of presidential elections .
the constitutional reform will deprive the majority of the current president 's power .
after the second round of voting in the supreme court , which declared november 21 as invalid , the central election commission urged the opposition leader viktor yushchenko to once again be deadlocked with kuchekov on december 26 .
" if the constitutional amendment is passed in the current form , all the powers of the president will be transferred to the parliament , which is unacceptable , " said viktor stefanko , president of the federation of soviet union .
" we hope the president will appoint the director of intelligence and the chief prosecutor so that we can fight corruption and get rid of the group that controls ukraine 's political and business sectors , " she told reporters .
kuchekov , who maintained close ties with russia , pushed for the revision of the constitution before holding a presidential election because he was worried that the opposition could win .
opposition congressmen yesterday refused to vote on the constitutional amendment proposed by the government , and the congress was adjourned for 10 days .
according to the constitutional amendment , apart from the prime minister , the defense minister , and the foreign minister , the power of appointment of all the heads of government will be transferred from the president to the congress . at present , forces supporting the government have nearly a majority in congress .
according to the contents of the amendment , the candidates for the prime minister , the defense minister , and the foreign minister appointed by the president will have to be approved by the congress , and the congress may also propose their candidates .
ukraine 's political crisis enters third week
ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko today called for support for continuing street protests in ukraine 's presidential election by surrounding the presidential palace and the government building until outgoing president kuchekov and his cabinet prime minister yuri yaakunkovic and their cabinet members take actions to ensure fairness of the forthcoming presidential election .
tens of thousands of ukrainian supporters gathered in the capital kiev for two weeks to encircle the government building and sleep in the street of the soviet experts as the main avenue for the military parade . the people they displayed forced the supreme court to declare november 21 a second round of presidential election invalid . the central election commission issued an order on december 26 to hold a re - election . the parliament has not yet signed an executive order to replace the successor .
viktor yushchenko told the crowd of support people gathered in the capital 's independent square tonight that kuchema should replace his government , reorganize his central election commission , and both parliament and kuchema should agree to amend the election law to prevent any corrupt election practices .
" before making these decisions , we cannot talk about removing the siege to the government building or the presidential palace , " he said in a speech opening the prelude to the december 26 election .
in the past 14 days , this square has demonstrated great love for ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of ukrainian people who can defend their choice . "
he said : " we are going through a struggle between good and evil forces . the whole world is applauding our victory . the whole world is proud of ukraine . "
at a time when the opposition party is intensifying its pressure on the ruling authorities in moscow , viktor yushchenko and kuchekov are once again deadlocked in their constitutional reform . polish president kwasniewski , lithuanian president marcoux , and russian special envoy gerzlov are scheduled to arrive in kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation .
egypt sees breakthrough in mideast peace process
egypt said that the middle east peace accord is expected to have a new framework .
it also said that it might send new ambassadors back to israel in the near future to restore the comprehensive diplomatic relations that had been suspended for four years .
egypt 's state - run middle east news agency quoted " senior egyptian officials " as saying that the parties seeking a peace plan have gradually reached a consensus on comprehensive reconciliation .
the middle east news agency said : " egypt , israel , palestine and major international organizations , such as the united states and the european union , have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to completely resolve the conflicts between israel and palestine . "
since palestinian strong arafat passed away last month , the international community has been pushing for the restoration of the middle east peace policy with a view to ending the bloody conflict between israel and palestine for many years at an early date .
the middle east news agency said that officials predict that " preparations will be carried out in july and then political actions will be taken again . "
the middle east news agency said that following that , israel and palestine , as well as egypt , the united states , russia and several european countries will hold meetings in washington .
it is expected that the meeting will cover " a cease - fire between the two sides " . palestinian authority will " stop anti-israel attacks " and strengthen its control over the gaza strip and the west bank . "
regarding this , the middle east news agency said israeli prime minister sharon promised " israel will stop its military actions against the palestinians so long as the palestinian authorities respect the cease - fire agreement and control their areas well . "
more than 1 billion children suffer from war aids
an annual report released by the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) today pointed out that more than one - billion children , or more than half of the world 's children , suffered from poverty , wars , and aids .
unicef said in a statement that children 's rights , which was clearly defined by the 1989 convention on children 's rights , were often harmed , partly due to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms .
" when half of the children in the world grow hungry and unhealthy , when schools become targets of attack and the entire village are destroyed with aids , we are unable to honor our promise to the children , " said ms. bellamy , executive chairman of the unicef 's executive committee in london in an annual report .
berri added : " the governments of too many countries are making a realistic , intentional choice that harms children . "
the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) , the london institute of economics and the university of brisbane in the united kingdom ( uk ) and researchers in the united kingdom jointly compiled statistics to expose children 's terror in most parts of the world .
researchers found that about 64 million children in the world are lacking proper accommodation , 400 million children are unable to get safe drinking water , 270 million children are unable to enjoy health services , and 140 million ( mostly girls ) have never studied .
researchers pointed out that , more importantly , at least 700 - million children suffered from various forms of " serious exploitation , " including inability to access information and enjoy public health facilities .
the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) said in its 10 th annual report that wars and aids had destroyed all kinds of networks that were usually able to protect children , and children became victims of wars and aids from time to time .
china puts pressure on eu to lift arms embargo
the european union today rejected chinese premier wen jiabao 's call for ending pressure on china 's arms embargo as soon as possible , but also said that it would make efforts to move toward lifting the 15 - year embargo .
the netherlands , the rotating president of the european union ( eu ) , made the above statement after the china - eu summit .
the netherlands said that it is not necessary to make wild speculation about how the eu should stop this embargo from drawing .
the european union imposed arms embargo on beijing after the 1989 tiananmen massacre .
although the issue of arms embargo cast a shadow on this china - eu summit , the two sides still signed several trade and other agreements at the meeting .
china and the eu both claim that these agreements have strengthened their " strategic partnership " .
in a joint statement issued after the summit meeting between the eu and chinese premier wen jiabao , the eu said , " the eu has confirmed its political intention to continue its efforts to lift the embargo . "
the statement pointed out that the chinese delegation " welcomes this positive news and believes that this message is conducive to the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between china and the eu . "
at a press conference after the summit , wen jiabao did not conceal his unhappiness . he said the embargo " did not reflect the partnership between china and the eu . "
wen jiabao said , " the embargo is the result of the cold war . it cannot reflect the current situation , still less reflects the partnership between china and the european union . "
some eu countries , led by france , pushed for the lifting of the arms embargo , claiming that it is outdated .
without revising the relevant eu laws , people of foresight in the eu are worried that lifting the embargo may open up the protective gate for arms sales , which will boost china 's military strength .
dutch prime minister baskean said , " i explained that the eu is willing to lift the embargo . however , i also pointed out that there is a relationship between lifting the ban and adjusting the code of conduct for arms exports . "
initial findings show that folic acid may lead to breast cancer but no final conclusion
according to the latest health research report , pregnant women will increase the chance of getting breast cancer by taking a type of vitamin b acid that is commonly used in order to prevent fetus 's abnormal change .
however , researchers said their research results might be accidental because other studies show that folic acid actually reduces the risk of getting breast cancer . therefore , they urge pregnant women to continue to take this supplement .
acidity in ye will naturally exist in dark - coloured folic vegetables , and the medical community knows that this is an important boost to the development of embryos .
researchers from the two universities of brisbane and arbner in the united kingdom followed up 3,000 women who took 5 mg or 0.2 mg of folic acid or placebo when they were pregnant in the 1960 s , most of which were in their second and third pregnancy .
the report published in the british medical journal pointed out that as of september 2002 , women who had consumed five mg of folic acid had breast cancer , which was only twice as high as that of placebo .
researcher nye stressed that this result was only " preliminary . " its purpose is to point out a way of further study . "
he said : " it is entirely possible that this is the result of an accident . therefore , before we reach any conclusion , we have to conduct further scientific research to review the interrelationship . if the link exists , "
nicosia said that women planning to be pregnant should still take ingredients of folic acid .
he said that currently there is a considerable gap between the dosage and the experimental dosage .
according to the uk 's hygiene standards , women who wish to be pregnant and in their pregnancy in phase 1 should take 0.4 mg of folic acid per day , 10 times smaller than the dosage taken by women in the above study .
ukraine 's presidential elections held in september
the two opponents who will meet in the presidential election on the 26 th of this month are now in full preparation for holding the upper house .
the pro - western opposition leader viktor yushchenko is confident in winning the election . the pro - moscow prime minister , however , said that he will no longer represent the " ashamed " ruling party in the election .
meanwhile , russian president vladimir putin changed his attitude on ukraine 's accession to the european union , saying he was happy to see ukraine 's entry into the european union .
asked him , he was looking forward to winning more than 30 percent of the votes during the re - election , viktor yushchenko told reporters at the press conference : " conservative , i should get about 60 percent of the votes . "
on the other hand , from the appearance of his anxiety , adunkovic did not directly answer reporters ' questions . in the end , he only said : " we will win if we want to be the emperor . "
yvukovic , who was cultivated by the former president kuchema as his successor , has changed his course and defined himself as a candidate against the opposition party and the ruling party .
he said in a nearly direct name - name way : " i previously trusted cowards and traitors who worked under the government . now i feel disappointed . this government is really ashamed . "
kuchema exchanged conditions with the opposition parties by amending the law to transfer part of their presidential powers to the parliament to end the two - week - long large - scale opposition struggle and political chaos since the november 21 presidential election .
the original victory also came under the charge of the supreme court , which declared the election invalid and had to be re - elected because of widespread irregularities in the course of the election .
powell 's last visit to the hague to do everything for harmony between europe and the united states
us secretary of state colin powell held talks with senior eu officials today , during which he devoted his last effort to the unity between the united states and europe in his term of office .
powell 's trip to europe is aimed at repairing the diplomatic damage caused to both sides by the iraq war , and the hague is its last stop .
powell 's visit may be his last official overseas visit . the european union promised to him that the european union would advance toward the path of resolving tensions between the two sides before us president bush 's visit to europe in february next year .
however , differences between the two sides still exist .
foreign minister ablott of the netherlands , which holds the rotating eu presidency , said : " we must strengthen bilateral dialogue and find a common position during president bush 's second term . "
madam president of the european union 's foreign affairs commissioner , madam hua delaware , said she believed that europe and the united states have made progress in " putting the iraq crisis in the back of its head " . however , she also realized that " the present is a critical moment in european - us relations . "
bush will fly to brussels on february 22 to meet eu and nato leaders .
powell said that bush 's trip was aimed at repairing the cracks in the relations caused by the iraq factor .
powell has visited sofia and brussels during his trip to europe , but the progress of improving relations is limited .
in particular , in brussels , powell criticized the six nato countries that opposed the war for their refusal to participate in iraq 's training tasks , which has damaged the " reputation and unity " of their allies .
however , powell still insists that his meeting has shown the united states ' commitment to fully resuming diplomatic relations .
romanian president elected faces challenge
romania 's opposition candidate , adrian jeremy , won the fierce presidential election here today , but the mayor of bucharest , the centre - right city in the middle , is likely to face tremendous challenges because there are many parliamentary parties in the country .
according to the final official results released by the romanian central election commission today , the " justice and truth union " candidate barghuti won 51.23 percent of the vote . his opponent and prime minister nastase got 487.7 percent of the votes .
nastase admitted his defeat and congratulated palestine 's shehr .
president iloilo , who is about to step down , has also congratulated pakistan on his departure from office .
nastase said that his social democratic party will assist barghuti to enable romania to smoothly join the european union .
the social democratic party won the parliamentary election on the 28 th of last month .
pakistan said in a press conference : " my top priority today is to form a government capable of continuing to implement romania 's accession to the european union ( eu ) . romania must strive to meet its request for joining the eu . "
he stressed that the romanian people should know the price to be paid for the integration and should unite to ensure that there will not be any doubts about the integration .
romania has completed the eu entry talks and is scheduled to join the eu in january 2007 .
pakistan has also listed fighting poverty , fighting corruption and ensuring judicial independence as its top priority .
guillermo theodore 's thoughts and remarks to turkey
film director orritsma schillon today took the opportunity of visiting istanbul to publicize the new film " alexandria " in an attempt to repair the old days with turkey .
the classic " midnight express " written by him was criticized as damaging the image of turkey .
he told afp during an exclusive interview here : " i have never thought that the script would be hostile to turkey . the script is an unjust act that opposes all places . "
turkish public opinion has condemned the history since the winning of this award was shown in 1978 .
the film was adapted from the memoir of billios .
us youth haiks was sentenced to 30 years ' imprisonment in turkey after long legal proceedings in an attempt to smuggle indian cannabis from turkey .
turkey 's hitter accused schwaz of arbitrarily changing its original version into a play with the meaning of racial discrimination , which is described by none of the turkish people as bad eggs in the drama .
there are also terrible scenes of rape and abuse in prisons in the film .
shi dong admitted : " perhaps due to my young age , and too much desire to express my arguments and express too strong feelings at that time , i have developed some fanaticism and anger . "
but he added , " haiks was indeed raped in a turkish prison . he was sentenced to 30 years ' imprisonment for relatively insignificant crimes and was also tortured in prison . therefore , everything is based on facts . "
" to a large extent , turkey is not the only country that operates an imperfect prison system , and the united states also has similar problems , " he said .
japan 's economic growth likely to slow down next year
japan 's economy is likely to slow down and enter 2005 , as the yen 's appreciation and widening gap between the rich and the poor may undermine the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the first half of this year .
analysts point their hopes of supporting japan 's economic growth to china , despite rising political tensions between japan and china , after 10 years of stagnation with high profits and strong consumer spending .
evidence is gradually showing that the japanese economy is likely to decline in early 2005 , particularly if industrial production continues to decline , while manufacturers adjust inventories to avoid overstocking up inventories .
according to the latest method of statistics , japan 's economy in the april - june quarter actually shrank slightly , with only 0.1 percent growth in the july - september quarter , which just escaped the technical slump .
economists are still divided about the strength of the japanese economy .
research staff of the france 's chillida bank estimated that japan 's economic growth could reach 2.3% in real terms in the fiscal year ending march next year and the next fiscal year .
they called the " recovery year 2005 " for reasons : the us economy has returned to the track of recovery steadily and japanese consumer spending has made up for the slowdown in exports .
another pessimistic view is that economists from the pfj predict a growth rate of only 1.8 percent for this fiscal year and a lower growth rate of 0.6 percent for the next fiscal year .
they pointed out the " potential risks " , which means that profits made by manufacturers did not lead to personal gains .
french fm : peace in middle east going to test france - us relations
after meeting with us secretary of state colin powell today , french foreign minister barnier said : the resumption of the middle east peace talks will " test " their transatlantic relations .
after palestinian leader arafat died , france called for holding an international seminar to promote the israeli - palestinian peace process , but no agreement was reached at the end of the meeting between barnier and powell .
barnier flew from paris to washington , where he held lightning talks with powell and his successor , national security adviser condoleezza rice , before heading for brussels to attend a eu summit .
both paris and washington agreed to mend their tight relations after the united states occupied iraq last year , but their differences in resolving the middle east deadlock remain clear .
" we want to improve the future relations between france and the united states , as well as between europe and america , " barnier said after a brief meeting between the us state department and powell .
he said : " i think the test of the core relationship lies in our ability to promote the peace process in palestine and israel . "
barnier earlier this week called for an international seminar on the middle east to be held at an early date in order to take advantage of what he called the " window of opportunity " that emerged after arafat died last month .
however , powell was still unwilling to make a commitment .
he said that the two discussed britain 's plan to hold a meeting attended by palestinians , but did not mention whether to hold a wider range of international meetings .
us officials have indicated that their primary task is to promote peace in israel and palestine and ensure the smooth progress of the palestinian elections next month .
the election will produce a leader who can control muslim militants and restore israeli - palestinian talks .
new japanese , rok talks to be held in january
japan and the republic of korea ( rok ) will start negotiations on a free trade agreement in january next year , japanese foreign minister nobutaka nobutaka nobutaka kawashima said tuesday .
speaking in talks with south korean foreign and trade minister ban ki - moon in kagoshima prefecture in southern japan , nobusuo nobutaka kawashima said both tokyo and seoul hoped to sign a free trade agreement by the end of 2005 and to resume negotiations as soon as possible .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korean president roh moo - hyun held a summit on the 17 th , during which roh moo - hyun urged tokyo authorities to be careful on the issue of imposing economic sanctions against north korea .
north korea kidnapped several japanese nationals during the cold war , and prime minister koizumi is facing tremendous pressure from people demanding punishment against north korea .
after japanese researchers concluded last week that the remains provided by pyongyang to prove that the two hostages had died were not the remains of the parties concerned , they were very angry about the kidnapping of the family members of the victims .
apart from the kidnapping issue , koizumi and roh moo - hyun agreed that the six - party talks aimed at preventing north korea from developing nuclear weapons should resume as soon as possible .
no concrete results have been achieved in the previous three rounds of six - party talks since north korea secretly developed its nuclear weapons program triggered confrontation in october 2002 .
north korea later boycotted the fourth round of six - party talks originally scheduled for september this year .
the six - party talks are south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan and russia .
thai prime minister expected to win february election
thailand 's prime minister , when thaksin was about to enter 2005 , was confident that he could win his second four - year term but his reputation had been damaged as he failed to stop the bloody insurgency .
thailand 's national elections are scheduled for february 6 , 2006 , with thaksin and his political opponents preparing for the election , most analysts expect a victory despite the outbreak of serious violence and bird flu in the south .
twelve people have died of bird flu in thailand this year and bird flu has swept across most of asia . however , in thailand , it is particularly serious . the thai government admitted that it has " made mistakes " in handling the epidemic .
but the health problem is unlikely to allow thaksin to be reelected , and on the contrary , many are asking what extent he would win and what significance would he have to the muslim rebellion in southern provinces ?
" the phenomenon here is that he enjoys popular support no matter how you look at dassin , " senate foreign relations committee chairman clesak told afp .
he said , " however , the situation will start to collapse next year . if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( his family and people around him ) and the unfair and violent situation in society . "
it is precisely due to social injustice and violence that turmoil erupted in the most heavily muslim region in thailand , and sporadic insurgency started in the first month of the month .
since january this year , muslim militants have targeted buddhist believers , government officials and security forces . they have also carried out bomb attacks and decoupled . so far , more than 560 people have been killed and 100 others are missing .
palestinian cabinet secretary says arafat poisoned one year ago
yasser arafat 's cabinet secretary disclosed that arafat was poisoned by a supporters delegation at the ramallah headquarters one year ago .
" something strange happened about a year ago , ' arafat was on september 25 , 2003 , " he told al - hayat daily .
at that time , the chairman shook hands with about 30 supporting representatives , and the chairman immediately showed vomiting .
since then , the president 's health condition has gradually worsened . "
arafat died of an unknown disease in a french hospital on november 11 .
a senior palestinian official said arafat was poisoned by people .
however , doctors in france said the accusation was groundless .
it was not until two weeks ago that the cabinet of israeli prime minister ariel sharon decided to oust arafat , but did not say what means he would use .
this threat from israel has triggered a wave of support for ' arafat from the world , and ' arafat has thus received a number of supporters ' delegations .
' arafat shook hands with these people . they came to express their support for arafat , who was surrounded by israel . "
on 25 september last year , ' arafat met two groups one from the whole world and another from the group advocating peace , and the other was from the political movement body .
" october 12 this year is arafat 's last illness , with the same symptoms . all of them are vomiting , lack of appetite , and all symptoms similar to a cold , " abu ghraib said .

us deputy secretary of state armitage issued a warning to syria today , saying that the future development of damascus 's relations with washington will depend on whether syria is willing to cooperate with the united states on the issues of iraq and lebanon .
armitage placed greater pressure on syria during an interview with reporters from arab countries .
the state department announced earlier the interview .
asked if he expected us - syrian relations would continue to be tense , armitage answered : " i naturally hope that relations will improve . however , this depends on what ( syrian president ) albanian people will do . "
the second figure of the us state department pointed out that damascus should carry out the un security council 's resolution 1559 passed in september this year and stop all its intervention in lebanon .
armitage said that syria 's action " is not killing with the united states , but singing a discordant with the entire international community . "
when the un security council discussed in january next year the question of whether the un peacekeeping force will continue to stay in lebanon , will the united states hand over the issue of whether syria will refuse to cooperate ? armitage 's reply was : " we are very likely to do so . "

putin says acquisition of yukos 's major assets aimed at protecting national interests
russian president vladimir putin said monday that russia 's acquisition of russian oil giant yukos 's main assets was to protect national interests and was also the first attempt to regain nationalization of the former soviet union .
" russia is now using an absolutely legal market mechanism to protect its national interests , " putin said at a year - end press conference in the kremlin , referring to the acquisition of yukos oil and gas company , a subsidiary of russian state - owned oil companies .
i think this practice is completely normal . "
russian state - run oil companies became their new boss today after purchasing baikal financial group of the russian - based basque petroleum and natural gas company , which previously held secret auctions .
russian state - owned oil companies announced late wednesday that they had already obtained 100 percent of shares of previously unknown baikal financial group .
the acquisition will enable the kremlin to firmly control russia 's key energy industry .
russian authorities have been attacking yukos and its prison founder in the past 18 months .
the state - owned oil company and the russian state gas company are merging , and the three oil and gas companies , together , will be in charge of one - fifth of russia 's total oil output and the production of all natural gas , making them the world 's largest energy group .
putin defended the country 's acquisition today by attacking the privatized boxes in the 1990s .
privatization measures at that time brought the most valuable assets of the russian economy into the hands of a small number of eight - faced excellent businessmen , such as khodorkovski .
baikal financial group previously offered a bid of 9350 million us dollars to purchase the controlling power of the yukos oil and natural gas corporation .

however , the head of the united nations office on humanitarian affairs in indonesia , aimmed , told reporters that the relief supplies could not be transported rapidly because of the wide range of issues involved in coordination and infrastructure .
after arrogant return to the capital of jakarta , airester told reporters over the phone , " we need a few weeks before we can deliver relief supplies to all isolated areas . "

japan offers 500 million us dollars in disaster relief funds to climb to first place in all countries
japan today promised to provide 500 - million us dollars in aid to countries affected by the indian ocean 's massive tsunami as countries vied to provide relief for the world 's worst disaster victims , the aid jumped to first place in all countries and increased the total amount of relief and reconstruction funds promised to date to 1.6 - billion us dollars .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said in a statement that japan , as the biggest economy in asia , will consider providing more aid , including money and technology .
he said : " japan will do its best to provide assistance in three areas : financial resources , knowledge technology and human resources . "
he said , " japan will temporarily grant 500 - million us dollars as emergency aid to disaster - stricken countries and relevant international organizations . "
koizumi also said he would attend a meeting of world leaders on the 6 th in the indonesian capital of jakarta to discuss aid to countries affected by the tsunamis .
after us president bush was criticized for being slow in responding to the catastrophe of mankind , the us government yesterday increased its promised aid by 10 times to 350 million us dollars .
china , which has been viewed as a growing challenge to japan 's influence in asia , has also promised to provide us $ 60.5 million in aid , which is a big figure for developing countries .
" japan will mobilize helicopters and personnel to make more contributions , " koizumi said .
japan will also consider deploying more forces as soon as possible , including aircraft , warships , and personnel of the japanese self-defense force . "

who : 50 groups to provide indonesia with medical aid
fifty aid groups have arrived in indonesia 's aceh province to provide medical assistance to survivors , the world health organization said tuesday .
the world health organization ( who ) is trying to coordinate all its groups and has held a meeting with them this afternoon , who 's representative peter pag said .
peter said it was very difficult to coordinate because many groups had already gone directly to aceh to carry out relief work .
peter said in a telephone interview in jakarta : " we are trying to find out the truth . every group has just arrived , but each group has expressed that they are willing to cooperate . "
peter said the main concern of the who is to prevent the outbreak of epidemics , such as cholera and bacillus , which could cause tens of thousands of deaths .
" we are very worried because many of us are homeless . they do n't have enough clean water or proper food , " peter said .
therefore , conditions are already ripe for the outbreak of infectious diseases . "
however , he stressed that there is no sign of the disease so far .
the indonesian ministry of health said that the death toll of sumatra could be as high as 100,000 , mostly in aceh province .
as most of the medical facilities in aceh have been destroyed , in the past week the indonesian military , the government of singapore and australia have set up at least eight field hospitals , and the united nations children 's fund has also started to send basic medical packets to help 200,000 children .
powell expects shiite faction to win iraq 's general election
us secretary of state colin powell predicted today that shiite would win the upcoming iraqi general election , but he also said there was no need to worry too much about the possibility of increasing iran 's influence in iraq because of the disharmony between iraqi shiite factions and iranian shiite factions .
more and more signs show that sunni muslims may boycott the january 30 general election and may be banned by the relevant iraqi authorities because of spreading insurgency .
powell said on abc 's " meet the press " program : " the new government to be in power will have a shiite majority .
most iraqi people are also shiite . "
shiite muslims account for over 60 percent of the population in iraq , most of whom live in southern and central iraq .
sunni people live in central and western provinces , accounting for 20 percent of the population .
former iraqi independent foreign minister pachachi , who currently leads sunni faction in the " iraqi independence democratic party , " called for a delay in the election today . however , powell said that iraq 's general election will be held as scheduled .
powell also said he felt that the future iraqi government under shiite control could not possibly mean that iran would control iraq 's political situation .
he said : " i think now that even if iran may have its influence , iran certainly will try to influence the iraqi political situation . however , there are great differences between iran and the iraqi shiite factions . in the past , there were serious discord and conflicts . "
wave after wave of international rescue gradually harms tsunami victims
foreign relief forces are airdropping food and building a clean water supply system in the tsunami - stricken areas in asia to help millions of homeless and famine victims .
according to statistics , the death toll has risen to nearly 150,000 .
the governments of various countries have been continuously providing relief supplies . us president bush entrusted his father , senior bush , and former president clinton to be responsible for soliciting donations from the people .
as for the us delegation headed by secretary of state colin powell , they arrived in thailand last night before a crisis summit meeting in jakarta , the capital of indonesia , to express us concern and assess the progress of rescue work .
powell 's entourage includes president bush 's younger brother , governor of florida jesse bush , and director of the us international development agency natos .
powell will lead a delegation to inspect the disaster situation in thailand , indonesia , and sri lanka and participate in the summit meeting on the 6th .
powell said that the purpose of his visit is to assess the disaster situation and observe what the united states needs to do . however , he promised to immediately increase aid without making a commitment of 350 - million us dollars .
since the disaster , there have been calls for giving up the search for thousands of unknown tourists , many of whom are foreign tourists .
however , thai prime minister thaksin vowed to continue the search in his country .
" foreign experts told reporters on puji island that they ( the missing person ) might be buried in the mud of mangrove . we will continue to do our utmost to search for them and will not stop their pace , " thaksin told reporters .
the largest - scale international rescue operation in history is continuing .
the naval helicopter dispatched by the us aircraft carrier " linqi " has already carried out a second day of airdropping relief supplies and carrying survivors in indonesia 's aceh province .
rear admiral crawford , commander of the navy , said that 50 - thousand pounds of food and water have arrived in the disaster area . the mission has been carried out " smoothly . "
political struggle behind behind aid for tsunami disaster
while the sources of materials for rescuing the victims of the asian tsunami were flocking into the disaster areas , a rather unusual activity was also being secretly carried out : governments are investing in that area on the one hand , and on the other hand , they should get assistance , and on the other hand , they should lead this modern largest relief operation .
the catastrophe that caused nearly 150,000 deaths caused the old flames of war , including the discord between the united states , the united nations and europe , and the struggle for the leading position in asia .
however , disaster relief experts still have cautiously hoped that this tsunami attack on too many countries might lead to a precedent : the countries that promised to provide assistance would truly fulfill their promise .
" the aid commitments made by the governments of all countries have never been 100 percent timely , " said juma zhuoma , professor of international development at the harvard university school of government .
the governments of various countries have promised us $ 2 - billion in aid , including un secretary general annan , us secretary of state powell , and other world political leaders , including leaders of australia , china , and japan , will hold a crisis summit in jakarta on the 6th , which has a strong political significance .
after being accused of being slow in response and the open criticism of the " stingy " of rich countries , us president bush increased us aid to nearly 10 times , increasing by 350 - million us dollars .
in asia , the secret influence of the tsunami disaster on the region has increased confidence that china 's promise to provide 60.5 million us dollars in aid is a big hand for a developing country .
japan , which has reduced its foreign aid budget for six consecutive years , has also rapidly broken down its national strength with action and promised to raise at least $ 500 - million in aid . this is a bit too difficult for all other countries .
world leaders visit sri lanka
sri lanka officials said world leaders , including un secretary general annan and us secretary of state colin powell , have arrived in sri lanka one after another to learn about the tsunami disaster that claimed 3600 lives in sri lanka late last month .
they said that powell had arrived here and south korean prime minister lee hoi - tsan would arrive later at noon .
a press release from the us embassy said that powell will visit some areas where the tsunami was the worst hit on december 26 last year , including the southern galler region of the us marine corps stationed for the rescue operation .
lee hoi - tsan will visit the west coast in the company of sri lanka 's prime minister , the south korean embassy said .
the statement said : " accompanied by sri lanka 's prime minister raffarin , south korean prime minister will visit the west coast to personally observe the loss of life , life and property caused by personnel casualties . "
lee hoi - tsan will stay in the newly created hekban tower to oversee rescue operations carried out by south korea 's non - governmental and non - governmental organizations .

un chief visits sri lanka 's rebel control programme
un secretary general annan said today that he hoped to return to sri lanka one day , " visit every place in this country . "
annan has just ended his two - day visit to sri lanka 's tsunami - stricken region , but there are reports that the government of the country has stopped him from visiting the northern region controlled by rebels .
" i hope to be able to come back to all areas of the country and help accelerate the peace process , " annan said when asked at a press conference whether the sri lankan government , as many national newspapers reported , stopped his visit to the rebel - controlled region of the " tamil tiger liberation organization " .
annan said he was personally opposed to his visit to areas controlled by the guerrillas because she was worried that the rebels would use his visit as a political bargaining chip .
he said : " i have raised the issue of the peace process and the necessity of strengthening efforts to strengthen the peace process .
i have also discussed this with president kuma . "
annan 's inability to visit the rebel - controlled area has angered local residents in the northern city of jaffna , where hundreds of people protested in front of the un office in the city .
however , the government of the country has firmly denied media reports that these media have " misled " them .
on the other hand , while people from all walks of life are making all - out efforts to deal with the disaster , the national meteorological agency warned that the country 's coastline is likely to be hit by a typhoon and the typhoon is now coming off the coast .
russian space agency denies rocket fuel causing child illness
russia 's space agency denied the report that children in its vicinity suffered from serious illness due to the highly toxic rocket fuel emitted during the launch of the spacecraft at kazakhstan 's bekonsha space base , a weekly scientific journal reported .

the research , quoted by the nature science journal , mainly focuses on children in the altai republic .
the republic of altay is located in the mountainous region on the edge of siberia .
the altay was selected as the target of research because of unburned fuel , especially ammonia .
in some cases , the russian space launch mission uses ucb as fuel for the previous several stages .
between 1998 and 2000 , the health records of about 1,000 children in the two polluting areas will be compared with the health records of 3,300 children in nearby uncontaminated areas .

us exports dropped to a new low of us $ 95.6 - billion in five months . at the same time , because us import orders increased by over us $ 14.2 - billion in oil products to us $ 14.2 - billion , an increase of over us $ 2 - billion , and a growth rate of 1.3% , us imports grew by 1.3% , reaching a record high of us $ 155.8 - billion .

the united nations has expressed concern over the deadline for the indonesian government to add foreign troops to it .
foreign troops ' aid and survivors of the most remote tsunami were well received .
nearly 1,000 japanese self - defense forces were on their way to the tsunami - stricken country on december 26 , killing more than 163,000 people .
this is japan 's largest deployment since the end of world war ii .
japan 's post - war constitution , which is dominated by the united states , stipulates that the self - defense force shall not use force .
political intervention in the content of the nmd hatch program ? japanese media set off the debate
it is reported that because of pressure from people in the political circles , the broadcasting corporation of japan ( nkk ) , a public - run broadcasting company , a few years ago , has shrunk in content when it broadcast a program aimed at imposing comfort women on the japanese army during world war ii . japan 's liberal media for this reason and its conservative stance .
it is said that the majority of the contents of the interview were deleted after discussions with senior politicians . most of the respondents were those who criticized japan 's wartime acts and those who were forced to be victims of comfort women . therefore , the liberal media criticized the practice of hatch .
the conservative newspapers , however , defended the decision to revise the content of the program , holding that senior executives of the company have the responsibility to ensure that the contents of the program are fair and objective .
the dispute broke out last week , and the key was a 2001 broadcast program aimed at mock trials of the japanese army 's offence of imposing comfort women during the war .
the trial was held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , and the court ruled that japanese emperor hirohito was guilty of permitting the japanese army to use comfort women during his occupation of various asian countries .
historians said that in wartime at least 200,000 young women were forced to serve as comfort women at the front - line japanese military 's warden . most of them came from south korea , but some were from taiwan , china , the philippines and indonesia .
well , the producer of the program , jing xiaowang , held a press conference with tears in his eyes on the 13 th , saying that before the program was shown , senior officials of the nkk had met with shinzo abe , member of the diet of the ruling liberal democratic party , and nakagawa , who expressed concerns about the contents of the program .
according to changjing , the upper echelons of the hatching program were subsequently edited and the contents were reduced .
he said , " i bow to political pressure . "
abe and nakagawa admitted that they had met with the staff of the nkk and told them they would be " fair , " but they firmly denied exerting pressure on the company .
euro zone data shows core inflation under control
economists said this week 's euro zone economic data would show that core inflation was still under control .
at the same time , both industrial production in the euro zone and consumer spending in france are expected to decline .
inflation is expected to rise slightly from 2.2% in november to 2.3% in december by the european union 's census and statistics department .
however , the rise largely reflected an increase in tobacco duty and the core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .
the core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer price data .
economists pointed out that core inflation , excluding food , energy , tobacco , and alcohol , has remained between 1.6% and 2% in the past two years .
the european central bank ( ecb ) said on tuesday that the price pressure has dropped recently .
while inflation is expected to remain at more than 2 percent in the next few months , it is likely to drop by the end of the year .
meanwhile , another economist said that industrial production in the euro zone on november 18 was also expected to decrease , due to a slowdown in german growth .
german industrial production fell 1.7% in november , while a survey conducted by the financial news agency on economists showed that euro - zone industrial production fell 0.4 percent in november after falling 0.5 percent in october .
us banks ' schmeding said industrial production in the euro zone is expected to rebound in december .
bureaucratic style causes two attacks on tsunami victims
three weeks after the worst tsunami attack in history , survivors are now fighting bad habits such as bureaucratic style and political command while global focus has shifted to other places .
thousands of decomposed bodies have been ferreted out one after another from the rubble , causing more than 168,000 people to die in the december 26 tsunami disaster . at the same time , the upcoming iraqi general election and president bush 's inaugural ceremony have replaced tsunami disasters and become the top news item on the media all over the world .
indonesia had asked foreign troops involved in humanitarian aid to withdraw within three months , but the request was recalled afterwards .
in thailand , leaders from canada , sweden , norway and finland are discussing the reconstruction plan and the identification of bodies .
however , survivors face new difficulties , such as the ingrained bureaucratic style in indonesia , which has hindered the distribution of relief supplies flowing into various parts of the world .
in a small village near the power station of the indonesian province of sumatra , the fisherman said , " we are in a house that does not exist at all . the tsunami has caused us to suffer heavy losses . we have lost everything and face hunger . "
he said , " we saw on television the food , clothing and other relief supplies flowing into aceh . "
like thousands of other disaster victims , brisbane has become a nightmare for him to lose his identity card and other official documents because of the tsunami .
although he earnestly requested the officials to go through the formalities every day , the result was the same : they could not get relief .
zeng qinghong reportedly went to visit zhao ziyang at the end of his life
chinese vice - president zeng qinghong went to hospital to visit former communist party of china ( cpc ) general secretary zhao ziyang , who died of illness , the information center for human rights and democracy said monday .
according to zhao ziyang 's family , zeng qinghong went to visit him at beijing hospital at 6 am . he passed away about an hour later at the age of 85 , the information center said .
zhao ziyang was dismissed from office as cpc general secretary and premier in 1989 because he opposed the use of force to suppress the tiananmen square democratic movement . he was then put under house arrest and has been regarded by the government as a non - welcoming figure .
according to zhao 's family , current premier wen jiabao , who had worked under zhao ziyang , did not visit him when he was in critical condition , the information center said .
however , before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on 14 august , tian jiyun , a retired member of the central committee who had served as his assistant , went to see him .
the information center of china 's human rights and democracy movement has kept in touch with zhao 's family , and for many years has issued the correct news on zhao ziyang 's situation at an appropriate time .
the center said that about 20 retired senior party , government , and military officials prepared to issue an open letter to the chinese communists , urging them to reassess zhao ziyang 's contributions , and asking them to hold public memorial meetings for him .
the center also said that zhao ziyang 's family would not be allowed to hold or make preparations for funeral arrangements and the party would have to make a final decision .
zhao ziyang 's wife , liang boqi , aged 86 .
because of her poor health , she said she had not been informed that her husband had passed away this evening .
china urged to promote democracy after zhao ziyang 's death
former chinese communist leader zhao ziyang passed away today , giving much respect to him , while japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , the taiwan government and overseas chinese democracy movement all called on beijing to implement the democratic reform plan of zhao ziyang .
zhao ziyang was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing military suppression of the tiananmen square democratic movement and spent his remaining life under house arrest . he passed away at the hospital in beijing this morning at 85 .
japanese prime minister koizumi said in memory of zhao ziyang , " i hope they ( china ) will strive for democratization . "
taiwan also called on china to carry out democratic and political reforms after zhao ziyang 's death .
overseas chinese democracy activists praised zhao ziyang as " one of china 's greatest reformists " and sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the tiananmen democracy movement .
lin shengde , former leader of the movement for free china in new york , said : " during his 15 years of house arrest , he openly advocated a political reform to march toward the rule of law and democracy .
zhao ziyang will be remembered by later generations as a real democratic and principled person . "
some pro - democracy activists urged the chinese government to hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and to fairly evaluate his achievements .
however , they admitted that zhao ziyang was not likely to receive the protocol because the chinese government was worried that those who were dissatisfied with communist rule would take advantage of this opportunity to create turmoil .
the 1989 student movement was caused by the death of reformist leader hu yaobang .
xinhua news agency reported today that comrade zhao ziyang 's death from an illness in beijing was the only official statement on this matter .

fm commissioner 's office expresses strong dissatisfaction over speech by chairman of the international relations committee of the us house of representatives
xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 3 , a spokesman for the office of the commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong issued a statement on the 3 rd , expressing strong dissatisfaction with a recent speech made by haide , chairman of the international relations committee of the us house of representatives in hong kong .

china 's largest sea water desalination project starts
xinhua news agency , hangzhou , december 6 ( pan yifeng and xu qun ) up to now , the sea water desalination project , which has the largest scale and a daily handling capacity of 10,000 tons in mainland china , will settle down in the putuo district of zhoushan , zhejiang province .
for zhoushan residents , who are suffering from serious water shortages , hundreds and thousands of years of sea water rolling around them will soon turn into clear and sweet water , and water will flow into every household .
the hangzhou water treatment and development center of the state oceanic administration ( soa ) and the governments of six horizontal township in the putuo district of zhoushan city signed an agreement on cooperation in water desalination .
the first phase of the project , with an investment of 50 million yuan and a daily output of 10,000 tons of fresh water , will be completed next year .
zhoushan city is one of the cities in china with relatively serious water shortage .
there are a total of 1,390 large and small islands in the whole city , with per capita fresh water possession of 601 cubic meters . this is only 25.4 percent of zhejiang 's per capita possession . the issue of drinking water has always been a problem affecting the livelihood of residents of this island city .
take the lianyan town in the putuo district as an example , the daily delivery of 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town , and the cost per ton exceeded 10 yuan .
the technology for anti-infiltration sea water desalination developed by the hangzhou water treatment and development center of the state oceanic administration is a process of separating the use of pressure as a driving force . it is a hot issue in the research field of seawater desalination .
a relevant person in charge of the center said : through technological improvements and equipment transformation domestically , the cost of anti - infiltration sea water desalination and the energy consumption have been reduced .
the cost of desalination and treatment for sea water per ton has further decreased on the basis of 5 yuan .
this indicates that the cost of seawater desalination is likely to be close to the price of tap water and industrial water .

this ivory carpenter is for a time considered the only temple found so far in the solomon era .

shi bou 's and his entourage showed their words and deeds : " it belongs to the holy palace of god and china , and a memorial service for god . "
these words were only engraved on the surface afterwards .

( international ) yugansk 's assets to be auctioned will not be included in russian natural gas industry shares
xinhua news agency , moscow , december 30 ( reporter song shiyi ) russian president 's office director and chairman of russian natural gas industry shareholding company medellin said to the media on the 30th that russian natural gas industry shareholding company will merge with russian oil companies as scheduled in january next year , but the assets of yugansk , the biggest subsidiary of russian oil company , will not be included in the assets of russian natural gas industry .
in addition , russian minister of industry and energy khristenko said on the same day that the assets of yugansk , which was auctioned off , would not be included in the assets of the russian natural gas industrial company , that this is mainly because the state is already the main shareholder of the russian oil and natural gas industry company , and the state does not want to increase its share in excess of the controlling share .
he said that yugansk 's assets will be stripped off alone and handed over to a completely owned company .
on the 19 th of this month , the russian federation property fund held an open auction of the 76.79% stake in yugansk , the largest yukos oil and natural gas company , at a price of 9.35 - billion us dollars .

analysts believe that an important reason that russia is ingeniously operating in the auction of yugansk 's assets is because it is playing a leading role in related legal disputes .
in september this year , russian president putin approved the russian natural gas industry company to merge with the russian oil company .
the russian natural gas industry corporation was founded in february 1993 and is the largest natural gas exploitation company in the world .
