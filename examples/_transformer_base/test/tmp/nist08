insurance industry not to divert domestic stock capital in the short term : experts
chinanews , july 30 -
according to zhongguo zhengquan bao [ china securities news ] , the " provisional procedures on management of overseas investment of insurance funds " were promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for use on the capital market .
liu lefei , chief investment officer of china life stock company , believes that the appreciation of the renminbi and the domestic capital market are good , and the insurance institutions will not invest in foreign currencies on a large scale in the short term . this also means that insurance will not flow into domestic stock markets in the short term .
the report says that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say that since there is no market for the rmb derivatives , the insurance institutions have insufficient means to avoid risk , so the time is not yet ripe for a large - scale purchase of foreign exchange .
liu lefei said : from a long - term perspective , foreign investment should account for a certain proportion of the overall disposition of insurance companies .
however , due to the greater pressure of renminbi 's appreciation , china life insurance will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
under the current circumstances , the purchase of foreign currencies for investment should be handled cautiously .

taiwan 's " department of justice " denies chen shui - bian 's involvement in elections and demands his explanation
chinanews , july 31 - chen shui - bian questioned legislators on the 30 th their attempt to intervene in the taiwan region 's leadership elections .
on the same day , gao jinzhi , " director of the executive department of the court , " said that the present performance of the judge on the island is inconsistent with what chen shui - bian said and demanded that chen shui - bian give an explanation of his statement .
according to a report by taiwan 's lien - ho pao [ lien - ho pao ] , chen shui - bian questioned judges , procurators , or investigators on 30 august , because of political factors or election considerations , to intervene , influence , or even attempt to influence the election activities of various party candidates . he said that he hoped such a phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , weng yuesheng , " president of taiwan 's judicial yuan " , failed to respond in a low - key manner . fan kuang - qun , " secretary general " , sent gao jinzhi to speak on behalf of the " department court . "
gao jinzhi said : the basic law and the " code of judges " of taiwan state explicitly that judges should be allowed to go beyond their parties , not to participate in party activities , and not to campaign for election campaign . judges should be very careful in observing the relevant restrictions , and judges are believed to have done well .
gao jinzhi cited an example to point out that a few years ago , zhang shengxi , judge of the kaohsiung supreme academy of science , attended the kada school course , which was decided by the discipline inspection committee formed for judges because the relevant curricula were of political party tint .
chang sheng - xi once wanted to take part in the primary of the democratic progressive party , but finally decided to give up because of disputes over taking part in the election .
gao jinzhi believes that if the trial of a particular case is conducted , the relief at the level of adjudication cannot be based solely on the outcome of the judgment , then the judge has other political intentions .

according to the oecd report , by the year 2010 , the number of people between the ages of 15 and 64 will decrease year by year .
if there are not enough immigrants , by 2020 , germany 's labor force will decrease by 6 percent .
however , an organization report by the german employers ' federation and the german association of engineers shows that there is a rather large gap of engineers and specialized technical talent in germany 's current labor market .
according to data from the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , the supply gap for engineers in the german labor market was about 127,000 , and the supply gap for technicians was about 9,600 .
in order to protect domestic employment , germany has set a relatively high threshold for attracting talented people from abroad .
germany 's " immigration law " stipulates that professionals in non - eu countries must not have an annual income of 85,500 euros , otherwise they cannot obtain work and residence permits in germany .
shawan proposed to reduce the quota to 40,000 to 60,000 euros .
do not have blind faith in law and the " theoretical circle "
article 8 of the " lawyer law " recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for examination stipulates that lawyers may be allowed to practise if they apply for lawyers ' professional titles or equivalent .
( 28 june , zhongguo qingnian bao )
in law , there are differences between " theoretical circles " and " practical circles . " the former mainly includes " abstract behaviors " such as legal teaching and research , while the latter mostly engage in " concrete actions " such as litigation , legal consultancy , and legal services .
over a long period of time , the law " theoretical circles " and " practical affairs circles " have the phenomenon of " scholars being weaker than civilians . " the " theoretical circle " held that the " practical business circles " lacked necessary legal knowledge and were merely mechanical " legal believers , " while the criticism of the " practical affairs circles " towards the " theoretical circle " pointed out that " theoretical guidance cannot be put into practice . "
as for these differences in the division of labor , the law can be carried out in a neutral manner rather than by giving strong support to either side .
however , the " franchise system " in the " lawyer law " has objectively recognized the " theoretical circle " of the law , which is higher than the " practical business circle " of the law .
as a matter of fact , some experts and scholars engaged in the history of the legal system and the international law of hong kong are purely engaged in the study and teaching of legal theories . their theoretical attainments is totally incompatible with legal practice .
in this way , the " system of licensed lawyers " has undoubtedly created a " bad precedent " for disqualifying the " practical business " of the law .
the superstition of the " theoretical circle " is more than these . for example , the phenomenon of frequently influencing the opinions of experts and the panel discussions of experts will affect or even rejecting court judgments is a direct manifestation of such superstition .

britain cuts alert level of terrorist attacks
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 th , by reporter lin guo
the british government lowered the alert level for terrorist attacks from the highest level to the " serious " level on the 4th . this indicates that british terrorist attacks will not occur in the near future , but it is still " very likely " .
at present , the british police are shifting the scope of their investigations to india and australia .
since all the eight arrested terrorist suspects are working in the medical system , the government will conduct an urgent examination of the background of the immigrants from outside the medical system working there .
nearly 90,000 people working in the british public health system are receiving medical treatment overseas .
prime minister brown also asked a survey on the background of high - tech immigrants , and employers or related agencies would be asked to provide background information .
do n't let traders trouble in public places
going out of the country for sightseeing is to relax , make clear , and enjoy to the greatest extent the fruits of natural scenery and social civilization .
however , many people have encountered such worries when traveling in china , and they are surrounded and intercepted by traders and intermediary businesses in public places .
whether it is cars or trains , and get out of the car , you always have to suffer from little traders and some dead - end fights without an intermediary .
it is not selling eggs , cooking cakes , selling newspapers and periodicals , and then introducing food and drink without an intermediary , or even selling fake certificates and invoices .
if you do not accept it , he can chase you for a few hundred meters , and if you are not successful , you will become a person of virtue .
in some scenic areas , many visitors also have the same feeling .
before entering the gate , people would sell such things as tourist souvenirs and handicrafts .
after entering the door , this kind of situation became even more serious , and no matter how good it was , it was thrown into confusion .
according to media reports , many foreign tourists visited xi'an , praising the scenic spots and sites there one after another , but they could not understand how many more small businessmen and hawkers were allowed to resell them everywhere .
public places such as stations and scenic areas , which are originally places for traveling and leisure , should stress civilization , orderly , quiet , and harmonious , and provide a comfortable and comfortable environment for tourists .
the free entry and exit of traders has disrupted the visitors ' feelings and , objectively , disrupted the public order of these public places and created visual pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , it has also provided the conditions and opportunities for lawless elements to stir up trouble .
what is important is that these public places are windows of the building of the spiritual civilization in hong kong . peeping at the sight of the entire seal is not only an issue of image , but also an issue of impact on the development of the local economy .
just imagine , if you want to make a big and strong tourist industry , but use such a chaotic and chaotic tourist environment to welcome guests coming from the south and north , who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy obtain benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it should be said that it is an urgent task to create a civilized tourist environment for tourists from the north and south of the city .
public places are not markets , the business activities of small traders and hawkers should be regulated , those that operate without a license should be resolutely cancelled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
only a civilized and orderly environment can make tourists happy and return to the motherland with all kinds of youthful vigor .
in a word , do n't let traders trouble in public places .
" reward for voluntary retirement " could not stand consideration
the building of streets in dongcheng district in beijing is aimed at issuing refrigerators and other commodities as a reward for the 12 low - security families to take the initiative to retreat .
( " beijing news " 10 july )
this writer is happy about the improvement of the living conditions of these families . however , the formulation of " taking the initiative to withdraw from the insurance " and the practice of " giving rewards " are also complicated .
the deputy director of jianchuan neighborhood office said , " encouraging people to take the initiative to withdraw their insurance in view of such problems as fraud and minimal assurance is an example to other low - security households . "
if this model encourages other low - security personnel to extricate themselves from their predicament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if this is the case , those who want to " urge " those who have been cheating on low security over a long period of time will be a bit naive .
it is law that relies on more efforts to differentiate and clear away genuine and fake households .
departments concerned should strengthen the obligations to be carried out by low - protection households when enjoying low protection : for example , promptly informing family members and income changes , reporting on the employment situation , and receiving regular reexamination , the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term plan to " withdraw from the insurance according to law . "
who will bury the material reward given to retired and protected families ?
as a first - level government organization , the streets are funded by financial resources .
should the taxpayers ' money not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal of low - security families proves that they already have a certain capacity to " be self - sufficient " ; on the other hand , is it not true that those applying for low - security assistance still exist ?
the government 's financial appropriations , which are called relief funds , should be delivered in snowy weather instead of adding fuel to the flowers .
liu gang - yi is more reliable to be a service provider .
on 10 july , liu yi , secretary of the cpc committee and secretary of the mulan town party committee of the xindu district of chengdu city , accepted the democratic assessment for the fourth time after taking office , and the satisfaction rate reached 97% .
in the conversation between this reporter and liu gang , liu yi defined himself as a " service man . "
( beijing news yesterday )
the " service providers " of liu gang - yi 's words may be more truthful and convincing than " service members " in the hands of some cadres under a system of appointment .
the greatest advantage of the system of direct appointments is that the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members and the masses . the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , and the direction of source of power determines that the former must give top priority to being responsible to the people .
the source of power and who are responsible for the work are the fundamental factors determining how the new leader works .
some people questioned such a " democratic assessment " as well as a " democratic show . "
in my view , if there is such a form of " democratic assessment , " it will be better than that .
considering the history and current situation of building democracy at the grass - roots level in china , i believe that direct election by the public is a major breakthrough . democratic appraisal is an important part of this pioneering undertaking , and we should not underestimate the work of promoting the building of grass - roots democratic politics .
india is expected to elect its first female president , saying that the possibility of winning the election is great , and that female voters hope that it will raise women 's status .
on june 23 , pali held the same hands in front of filling out the presidential document .
the presidential election began on the 19th . the new president will be born between the current vice president shaukat aziz and the former governor of the state of sralt patzar batistr .
abu sultani is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become the first female president in indian history .
( filmart ) is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while khaleda zia is from the opposition people 's party .
since the congress party holds a dominant position in the election of the president , the media and the people have been guessing one after another that it is quite likely that ( bur ) will be elected .
the 72 - year - old berg is the female governor of the state .
she was a lawyer and had rich experience in political affairs in 1985 . she received favorable comments from the government while serving as governor of rajiv state .
she has also devoted herself to social welfare and is honorary chairman of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .
analysts have pointed out that the reason that parks became its candidate was due to her unswerving loyalty to sonia gandhi , chairman of the congress party of india .
in india , the gandhi family has been controlling the ruling congress party for a long time .
with the backing of a large number of female voters , mastir believes that it will reshape the image of women in india , a country where female discrimination is serious , and raise the status of women .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is the commander - in - chief of the state and armed forces in his name , and does not represent any party organization , but more is a symbol .

scientists of the swiss academy of sciences have conducted long - term tracking and research and found that more than 1,800 ice sheets in switzerland between 1850 and 2005 are decreasing at an average annual rate of 3 percent .
the heat wave in 2003 alone caused the glacier to melt 1.8% .
experts believe that by the 21 st century , if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees celsius , the glacier will decrease by 80 percent as compared with now , and the ice will melt further by 5 degrees celsius .
the glacier , the longest glacier in europe , has been listed in the unesco 's world natural heritage list , but it has been reduced by 100 meters in one year from 2005 to 2006 , and protecting the natural environment has become a matter of urgency .

us defense department reconsider reduction of us forces in europe
the u.s. department of defense is reconsidering plans to cut the number of u.s. troops in europe by about half in 2002 due to changes in the iraq war and the world situation , a u.s. defense department official said today .
us media quoted an official of the defense department as saying that since the iraq war is still going on and us relations with russia and iran are worsening , the defense ministry leadership has raised doubts on the possibility of reducing troops stationed in europe .
in 2002 , then us defense secretary rumsfeld announced that the united states would reduce the number of its troops stationed in europe from 113,000 to 710,000 by 2012 in order to build a " small but streamlined " new army .
at present , the total us military strength in europe has dropped to 100,000 .
however , in june this year , krakow , commander of the us european command , submitted a report to the current us defense secretary gates , raising questions on the aforesaid reduction plan .
the report says that while the us troops stationed in europe are decreasing , many of them are being transferred to iraq and afghanistan in turns to fight , causing a shortage of us military personnel stationed in europe and rendering it unable to carry out normal cooperation with its european allies .
the report recommends a halt to the reduction of us forces in europe .
relevant us experts believe that the above phenomena show that the long delay in the iraq war has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the us military .

chengdu , july 3
qu mao and yang ruyu reported : " we can live in an apartment , thanks to the determination and courage of the party committee office of the group . "
today , more than 10 cadres of a communication training group of the chengdu military region who moved into an apartment building were all elated . they expressed their respect and gratitude for the work style of the " leading members " of the group 's party committee in daring to deal with tough problems in real terms .
a few years ago , with the replacement of personnel , some housing units in the residential buildings of this general unit were occupied in violation of regulations , which made it difficult for cadres on active duty to live in houses . officers and men have a great deal of opinions on this issue .
the group had also cleared their houses several times , but they all failed to settle the problems due to various resistance , thus making this issue an old and difficult one .
" so long as we dare to be more sincere and reasonable , we will not be able to solve any difficult problems . "
after a consensus was reached among the leading members of the new party committee , the principal leaders personally started to thoroughly sort out all the problems of occupying the premises in violation of regulations .
while convincing people with feelings , they hoped that relevant personnel would take the overall situation into consideration and , on the one hand , would explain the relevant policies and regulations concerning military dormitory , fund - raising house , and economical and practical housing , to show the party committee 's firm resolve and principled stand .
with regard to personnel who have housing elsewhere and are unwilling to withdraw from their houses , party committee organs have promptly contacted their units , and have taken corresponding measures to urge them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the troops .
after two months of meticulous work , all households in the barracks that violated regulations and occupied houses were moved out of the barracks on schedule , and cadres at the brigade level were given housing according to regulations .
the work style of the party committee of this unit in daring to deal with tough problems has also produced a chain effect . as a result , several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively coordinate with the organization in their assignment have now expressed their willingness to submit themselves to the organizational decision .

july 7 military uniforms designer invited to china military online
from august 1 , pla units will wear their 07 - type uniform one after another .
this evening , the china military online specially invited chen jun , deputy director of the material , fuel , and materials department of the general logistics department , and su yang , senior engineer of the armament research institute of the general logistics department and one of the designers of the 07 - type uniform , to a chinese military website to talk freely about the background and the development process of the new uniform 's coming into being . this has evoked repercussions among internet users .
the two guests are the direct participants in the design and development of the 07 - type uniform .
when talking about the changes in the new uniform , they explained that the 07 - type uniform is designed on the basis of the new equipment , especially the 97 - type uniform . as many as several hundred improvements have been made in the seven aspects of military uniform series , standard , and pattern .
the most important feature of our uniform in july is that it embodies the requirements for its series of lines , functions and personnel , and makes our military uniform conform to the standards of coordination , variety , and series of standards for the three armed services for the first time , and indicates that the level of our military 's military uniform building has taken a historic leap .

platform set up at people 's armed forces department in jingjiang to improve the quality of military cadres
on june 18 , the guidance course on " psychological warfare under the condition of winning the information warfare " given by lu yuqing , minister of the armed forces of the west town of jingjiang in jiangsu province , was unanimously praised by the participants .
this is a new change made by the city 's people 's armed forces department in light of its actual situation in assigning pressure to specialized military cadres and in focusing on improving the overall quality of military cadres .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered in its investigation and study of the grass - roots units that some military cadres had too long a term of service and too many positions at the same time had not focused their main efforts on armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted such methods as centralized training , training on behalf of meetings , and relying on the training of local party schools to train specialized military cadres at regular intervals , and have devoted efforts to resolving the problems of narrow knowledge scope and unitary professional quality of specialized arms cadres .
in conjunction with the work of the center , they should be bold in assigning tasks and burdens to cadres specialized in military affairs , and enhance their abilities to work at posts through on - the - job training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly formulated a " plan for competitive appointment for specialized arms cadres , " clearly stipulating that armed ministers must be appointed to leading bodies of party committees at the same level and that armed forces ministers must no longer hold other posts concurrently .
we have established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of specialized arms cadres , and readjusted and exchanged in good time a number of specialized arms cadres who are aged too old and are not suited to the armed forces work at the grass - roots level , and have promoted and applied them to the comrades with good overall quality and strong work ability .
not long ago , chen yisong , director of the armament department of the new century shipbuilding company , led the militia technical detachment in developing new technologies for welding underwater vessels to fill the gap in the country and be upgraded to minister of the armed forces department of the company .
at the beginning , the good will still have to come to a good end.
in terms of the results of the competition alone , the score of 2 to 2 is reasonable and acceptable to the chinese team , and the key lies in the process of the game , which is regrettable .
if the iranian team took a lead of 2 - 0 , then the chinese team would pull the score out , which would surely give the chinese fans a different feeling and boost their morale very much . it is regrettable that the situation is just the opposite .
at the beginning , the good will not come to a good end , and it can be said that it was an old problem for the chinese team .
the chinese team often does not play the ball under an excellent situation and the general view is that the psychological quality of the chinese players is not too high .
this is indeed one reason why the chinese team is unable to " reach a good end . "
however , from the perspective of the chinese team 's competition today , it seems not as good as anything else .
sun jihai , sun xiang , shao jiai , and zheng zhi once kicked the ball in europe . li weifeng and others were also long - standing veterans who knew many things about li weifeng . in terms of reasoning , they would not have any psychological problems .
the reason for the chinese team 's regret is that the iranian team did not send troops back at the last minute .
the iranian team changed to two when it was backward and the scene immediately changed .
the chinese team also replaced three players in the second half , but the results were not good .
it is necessary to accurately find the root cause of the problems by overcoming the problems of failing to good start and end well .
as long as the problems are accurately identified , it is probably not difficult to find a solution to change the problems .
they were afraid that they would wantonly seek medical treatment if they were sick .
if this goes on , the chinese team will play more matches , old problems will continue , and there will be no further fights as everybody is expecting .

the second artillery corps ' base " small , remote , and direct " educational coordination area begins operation
the phenomenon of small , scattered and directly subordinate units being unable to organize education , having limited resources and fighting their own battle will become a history at a base of the second artillery corps .
this reporter recently learned that after six months of experiments , the base issued the " implementation measures for implementing the ' outline of ideological and political education ' " on a trial basis , covering all small , scattered , and directly - administered units on the base and formal operation of certain ideological and political education coordination zones .
in order to promote the effective implementation of the " outline of ideological and political education , " the base at the beginning of the year organized forces to conduct in - depth investigation and study on the current ideological and political education situation in small , scattered and remote units , and sorted out key problems affecting and restricting the time , personnel , and results of education , thus initially forming a new type of educational model for small , scattered , and directly administered units .
the specific method of the joint operation zone is to break the demarcation line of the establishment of a unit , take the lead in assigning a brigade level unit in a relatively concentrated unit in a small , scattered , and directly subordinate unit to a brigade level to conduct unified planning for thematic education , and different units affiliated to the unit either come close to the station to listen to the class or engage in long - distance discussions with the video system .
adopting the method of combining rotation of classes with appointment to posts through competition , unified deployment of educational forces , unified use of educational hardware in each district , sharing and exchanging data and educational experience in each unit , and organizing regular roving reports and sharing of experiences among officers and men of every region .
each co - operation zone has set up full - time educational liaison personnel and part - time educational information collection personnel .
on this basis , the various coordination districts have also established a system for seeking help for difficult problems , jointly discussing major educational topics , reporting on urgent ideological situations , and assessing and appraising problems .
zhang shengmin , director of the political department of the base , told this reporter that the establishment of a political education coordination zone has not only reduced the waste of educational resources but also deepened the results of education .
some political teachers fear that they will lose points in front of the officers and men of other units , take the initiative to study new knowledge , and explore new methods for education .
officers and men who have been educated should also actively absorb the contents of the education , and should not speak out in front of the officers and men of neighboring units when discussing and analyzing the education .
as a result , the enthusiasm of educators and recipients of education has been effectively stimulated .

the central discipline inspection commission , i am worried about the effect of your " deadline anti - corruption " campaign .
[ 2002 - 02 ] [ 10 ] text version of the text message for 2007 - 02 ] [ 10 ]
beginning 30 may , the central commission for discipline inspection gave a deadline for corrupt and corrupt elements in all parts of the country . that is , as of 30 june , the commission will not take the initiative to confess within a certain period of time .
i could not help feeling dumbfounded after hearing this , and the police told the thief one month ahead of schedule that they would immediately come to tell the thief that they would take the initiative to confess , otherwise they would catch you , so how could there be such anti - corruption activities in the world ?
is this not tantamount to telling the corrupt officials that they are rushing to hurry up and transfer the evidence ?
what is its intention ?
hey , there is simply no way to speak of this .
when we speak , even if it really works , what will the effect be ?
can we contain and deter corrupt officials ?
we do not rule out the possibility that those who are afraid of it will take the initiative to explain it , but will not run even more ?
we cannot say whether the fight against corruption by the central discipline inspection commission has achieved remarkable results or not , but the other role is probably to play .
that is , all corrupt officials in various localities are delighted to see that they are grateful to the central discipline inspection commission .
in a month 's time , it is enough to hurry up to transfer the capital and financial resources .
if i were corrupt officials , i would never think so , would n't have reported to you on your own initiative .
the rejoicing of the corrupt officials all expressed this : ha ha - ha , thank you !
the people were indeed puzzled . how could it be so difficult to carry out the struggle against corruption in a sweeping and decisive manner ?
how big will such an anti - corruption campaign play ?
in short , the central discipline inspection commission , i am worried about the effect of your " time limit anti - corruption " campaign .
land not being privatized is my heart 's bottom line
[ an idiot , 2007 - 07 10 : 39 ] [ 3 ] text version ] [ text version ] [ 4 ]
land not being privatized is my heart 's bottom line
i think i 'm not an easy person , at least i myself feel it 's like this .
it has always been rational and rational to speak at the forum , and rarely has it lost its senses and nonsense .
i have always had a high degree of confidence and ardent expectations in the party central committee , and no matter how much reform measures are in line with my concept , i can accept them and regard them as one of the " characteristics .
however , once the land is privatized ( or in disguised form privatization ) , all this will lose the basis of existence .
land resources are the greatest social resources if we want to lose thousands of troops and not even an inch of land .
labor people and land resources are the foundation of a country .
as long as the nature of national land resources remains unchanged , the nature of this country will not change easily . once the nature of national land resources is changed , everything will basically change .
i am not a member of the communist party of china , but i remember clearly that i once made the following vow : " love the motherland , love the people , study well , temper well , and be ready to devote myself to the cause of communism ! "
" study hard , work actively , be the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts , and struggle for the cause of communism ! "
like me , those who once vowed to sing " we are socialist successors , " and if they were not shameless , then they should have remembered their previous oath .
if you have betrayed your pledge , invite you to stand up and walk away from the side of the " communist party , " while holding this signboard to deceive and cozy up to the masses , you are pondering how to sell this signboard to a good price .
of course , i hope that all these worries are uncalled - for , but i hope i can always remain rational and calm .
we should remember that " we are socialist successors .
what if there is no such thing ?
feelings of one generation , two times
someone asked : is it true that someone 30 years old has mao zedong ?
later he was changed to 20 years old .
in fact , people in this age group have never experienced the mao zedong era at all , and people who raise this question do not know whether their brain is perishable or congenital .
in the city , people who have the greatest say in the era of mao zedong should be people who have personally experienced those times and people who have suffered untold sufferings , that is , people who should be born between 1950 and 1960 .
after their birth , their parents took part in sports and did not give their children the relatively love .
when they need nutrition , they caught up with three years of natural disasters and suffered from hunger .
they started to go to school , and also had a cultural revolution , and neglected their studies for several years .
some even end their studies for the rest of their life -- they were 15 to 17 years old and had no choice but to give up their studies , respond to the party 's call , go down to the countryside , and support the border areas .
after working , they held that the working class was the most glorious and voluntary choice for the most dirty work .
it was glorious , a lair of life .
when they got married , they started to have a late marriage with only one child .
they should be paid a diploma from an enterprise because they do not have a diploma .
they worked hard to raise their children and provide them with basic education . they entered a university and caught up with the reform of the education system .
as their age increases day by day , they begin to get sick , and unfortunately they catch up with the reform of the medical system , with the result that they are unable to get medical treatment due to illness .
we can see that the unfairness of the entire society has been brought to bear on this generation .
however , among these people , few opposed mao zedong and attacked mao zedong .
why ?
they are not the lackeys of mao zedong . they have blood and meat and live in a solid group in our society . they personally experienced the history of going down to the countryside to get laid - off and unemployed people and looked squarely at the social phenomena of the two times .
although they were not satisfied with the waste of study , food , clothing , and even hatred of some bad phenomena in the mao zedong era , they still believed that the mao zedong era was good in terms of national spirit , morality , and social atmosphere .
some net friends ' parents are just this generation of people , you can talk to them .

injected with melon " cancer banana " and " cardboard bag "
[ text version ] [ 19 , 2007 , 22 : 57 ] a news report the year before last said that watermelon in hainan was injected with a injection device into it , resulting in the collapse of a large quantity of watermelon in hainan and the loss of a large quantity of hemp farmers ' blood .
the cctv then carried a follow - up report , which confirmed that there was no such thing .
this report was very mysterious at the beginning because it was impossible to get shots from watermelon one after another , not only without any practical significance , but also in terms of workload .
last year , the memory was clearer , and some media reported that the banana tree in hainan was suffering from a kind of illness similar to human cancer , and the banana tree that fell ill could not avoid dying .
as a result , many people misunderstand that bananas can suffer from cancer . as a result , the prices of bananas in hainan have fallen dramatically .
the above two reports have both caused a sensation because they directly touched the most sensitive issue in people 's nerve , that is , the issue of food safety .
if the media said that so - and - so food would endanger health , then it would surely spread all the time , and people would generally adopt a more trusting and unbelievable attitude toward the objects involved . as far as a person is concerned , having fewer watermelon and bananas in hainan could not be counted as anything extraordinary , but they would have a great impact on the production and sales of the products .
not long ago , beijing again exposed the strong material about food safety , that is , because of the price increase in pork , some people actually used cardboard boxes to process the case and produce the box . that is , the cardboard box .
i was deeply shocked when i heard of it , and felt that the peddler was too capable of studying this method and could actually come up with such a method . moreover , the news was widely spread afterwards , advising his family and friends not to buy the bag anymore .
yesterday , however , there was news suddenly that the cardboard report was false , and the entire story was fabricated by one person . so , what exactly is the news media today while waking out ?
the truth i have learned from reliable channels is that chen ci , temporary member of the " transparency " column of the beijing television station life channel , brought with him the meat chain , flour , and cartons purchased from the market , and instructed wei and others to mix the cartons with the flesh and blood after soaking them .
sakurauchi took pictures of the production process with a household dov in his own belt and then broadcast it by deception .
at present , the public security organs have already conducted a criminal detention of criminal suspects , and will severely punish them according to law .
after the pao case occurred , the government immediately organized relevant departments to conduct an investigation and conducted an all - directional and thorough inspection of the beijing breakfast market to ensure the safety of the common people 's dining tables .
after the incident was confirmed , beijing television station has made an open apology to society , learned a profound lesson , strictly investigated and dealt with those who should be held responsible , and will further strengthen management , plug up loopholes , and resolutely put an end to false and untrue news reports .
however , although the cardboard boxes were full , it is still uncertain when we would go back to the stall again .
this affair also reflects , from one aspect , the government 's emphasis on food safety and the rapid action taken by the government . to a certain extent , it also shows that the table of the people in beijing is quite safe . the bun incident has caused a false alarm to everyone !
who should be held responsible for education ?
recently , i heard friends from home talking about what i saw and heard in a school , which made me feel grateful .
the incident occurred at a private middle school in shanghai - southwest sex middle school .
the school has decided to offer the best arrangement for three teachers to be recruited from the junior high school level until they are upgraded to senior high school , while allowing several young teachers with no teaching experience at all and poor teaching results in the past to take in several other schools or upgrade them from outside .
the reason is that the students who signed the agreement at that time agreed to give up other senior high school examinations , so the school had to give them the best teachers in accordance with the agreement .
as for the students in several other classes , the attitude of the school is : give the young teachers the chance to undergo training .
i cannot help feeling that education is really responsible .
i remember that when i was studying at a key senior high school many years ago , the whole class was dissatisfied with the teaching standard of a mathematics teacher and asked the school to change its teacher regardless of the heaven and earth .
the school really changed our teacher later because the school had promised to treat every student equally and to be responsible to every student .
he has been to the united states for 10 years to study postgraduate courses .
when selecting the second term in a summer , it was found that all the selective course arrangements in the department were theoretical courses and that some highly universal courses were not arranged .
i ran out to talk to the director of the department , telling him that he thought there was a problem with the course setup .
department heads admit that the lack of suitable courses is due to insufficient teachers , which can be opened when there are teachers in one or two years .
i remember at that time he said , " this is your problem , not me .
i came to your school from shanghai to study because i was attracted by your curriculum introduction .
if you do not have the ability to run these courses , you should not introduce them . otherwise , it is false advertisements and it is irresponsible to me and my family . "
after hearing my words , the director of the department wanted to say , " well , i see how this can be resolved .
it may be too late , because all courses have already been arranged and registered online .
three weeks later , the head of the department talked to me and told me that his job was to be responsible to every student , including me .
he listened to my suggestion and exerted the greatest efforts to add two highly universal selective courses , hoping that i can understand it .
after the occurrence of this incident , i studied several subjects for my department director .
he never had prejudice toward me because i had given him advice , and he gave me a class a fair answer .
on the eve of graduation , i heard his secretary said he had done his best to every student but not every student thanked him .
at the graduation ceremony , i told the director of the department that everyone was grateful from his heart for what he had done for us because he had done his best to bear responsibility for everyone of us .
i feel that i have made the correct choice of life to go to school here .
on this point , i see that there is hidden tears in the eyes of the department director . if one day every education worker in china and the entire education system are responsible to every student , i think the day china truly takes off will not be far off .
entraptir yag yasuda
last sunday , we took part in a men 's 4 - man volleyball tournament in central new york for six and a half hours .
this competition is actually organized in order to prepare for the training competition in the new york state summer games ( ecmpal ) .
the coach split the four men 's teams ( the squadron , the university team , the 35 - year - old team , and the 45 - year - old team into the team , each consisting of one or two lines .
the rules of the competition are very interesting , but they can only launch attacks in the rear row and not lift the ball to the three - meter line . they can only kill one person to block the net , not change the position .
so it is basically testing the strength of attack and the position of defense judgment .
our team had a 2 - meter interface . the offensive was both a point of strength and a high point . more than 60 percent of the offensive and score were carried out by him .
a 1 - meter 90 - meter secondary attack made quite a few mistakes due to behind - the - scenes deployment .
in addition , the main thrust of my attack is 1 : 75 , from time to time carrying out surprise attacks , and the success rate is still comparable to that of the opponents , with the main hitting the ball .
there were seven teams in the team first in a round - the - clock game . our team won one victory and broke the rules when they were attacked . this greatly affected the morale of our side and caused three successive losses .
however , after losing the game , people have become mentally calm and coordinated with each other to achieve stability in these three places , so they started to win one victory after another .
when the round - the - clock competition ended , our team won three wins and three losses , and ranked sixth in terms of small score .
in addition to ranking first , the other two to seven teams arrested each other in the competition .
in terms of mental and tactical stability , our team won a strong battle and took the lead in the semi - finals .
the opponents in the semi - finals beat my strong opponents and beat me with one piece of purple . however , once i take a weight , the joy will be twice as great as i 've successfully grabbed a ball .
i do n't know how much the score will win .
in the final , our opponents scored a balance of defense , and our side played quite a few games and took the lead all the way .
at the end of the 2:24 , our side was in possession of a game . the other side even told me to take the two matches . the match between us on the other side told me that it had nothing to do with me .
the next ball was flying toward me , and i had a good job with it . the second piece was passed on to me to respond , and i remember to resolve the battle .
let 's talk about morality .
for individuals who are scattered and free , there are already a lot of moral issues .
i have nothing to talk about in this regard .
what i want to say now is about the collective .
we often encounter situations where collective needs .
on such occasions , there is a need for a collective to have some ethics .
we can often find some very good morals in those successful collectives .
this is by no means accidental .
as far as these undertakings or activities are concerned , we need to overcome some immediate difficulties , get united , and exclude those factors of belief . i think those good morals have also played a role not to be ignored .
at least , it is very difficult for a group of people with very low moral standards to live together in a successful event , and we can be very sure to predict .
it may be because one can see from a rational long - term perspective that the wisdom of long - term interests is a must for collective success .
as a matter of fact , collectives can often obtain idleness , usage , words , beliefs , and morality in various ways .
it is only in the morning of bailan and the evening of the white land that the orchid is everywhere .
( exploring ) as of now , how many times have you really been happy ?
my good friend and good friend at senior high school , finally obtained the visa , and by the end of august they could leave for a cattle school on the west coast of the united states to study .
today , several students gathered at the primary school and really felt happy for her and finally got their wishes .
seeing her so happy , i really envied her .
think of the length , i was only so happy that i was admitted to a senior high school at that time . i never thought i was able to get into a number of well - known schools in the whole city at that time . after that , it was logical that i studied at university , worked there , and i was not so happy at all .
admitted to the university , it was not the one i wanted before , so i was not happy about it .
during the time when i graduated from university , my only trust was to go to the north and meet my two - year - old gg .
one month before i graduated , he proposed to break up , and all my previous illusions went into thin air .
afterwards , i returned to work in north china . today , i worked almost two years , i earned the money of a medium - sized sedan , but i never was so happy any more .
in my chat with her good friends today , i can feel the joy of having a year of preparation for going abroad successfully and starting a new life , and it is really pleasant to see her dream come true .
i have no plans to continue reading , nor do i like life abroad , because after working abroad for half a year ago , i found that life abroad is not suitable for me .
seeing the happiness of good friends , i do n't want to think , what is my pursuit ?
what can make me so happy ?
it may be to find people who really like me , who are willing to take the second half of my life .
i think at that time , i would cry excitedly , just as my good friend told me , when she got the customs clearance through the embassy interview , she could not help but cried , worked hard for a year , worried , finally got a reward .
and i ?
in my feelings , whenever i have to make an effort to operate , i will still be able to repay my wishes and cry happily .
maybe i am not worried about my own career , just feeling ?
when will my feeling end ?
on this issue , i am always sad .
all of you , dots , you ?
how many times have you really been happy when you live ?
publicity campaign to promote tai hing college
oh , it can also be considered as introducing the situation of the building institute to the alumni of the dongcheng university .
the latest first - hand information may add to my feeling , such as false contract replacement .
president wang , secretary an , and teacher li of the personnel department of the ministry of construction technology and science , as well as several other teachers from the teaching and research office of construction science and technology , attended the report and i spoke for an hour and a half before everyone talked about it for about one and a half hours .
at the end of the formal report , teacher zhang ( assistant to the director ) dragged me to the side and talked to me about the closing door of my office behind me .
he was very amiable and told me that he said something wrong at the formal meeting , saying that he could not say anything about my income from the future , so he told me about the specific income of some teachers in the construction institute , so that i could feel at ease .
before the report , president wang gave a brief account of the building institute , saying that there were only six key disciplines in the nation 's construction category , two in the east , two in the qinghua university , one in the tongji and one in the tianda categories , and there was nothing else .
he said that in recent years the state has paid special attention to energy conservation , green building and construction technology , and the eastern university wants to introduce a teacher in this area .
he said that they have received more than 20 requests for biographical notes on them , including some in china , some in japan , and others in the united states ( it seems to be one of me ) .
the construction college attaches great importance to this and has conducted a serious inspection of these new recruits .
compared with the building institutes of some other institutions of higher learning that i know , the eastern university is indeed relatively leading , and tongji 's town planning should be a little higher than the eastern part , but from the perspective of building design , it seems that the eastern university can still hold a little lead ( i did not expect it before ) .
president wang said : over the past two years , the institute has spent sufficient funds on scientific research and has been under the state 's priority construction of 985 key projects .
he told me last year that a total of 10 million yuan was allocated to the dongda construction project , 3.5 million of which were directly used to purchase books to replenish the professional library of the architectural institute ( ha ha ha ) , and i would like to praise them !
) almost all the remaining experimental equipment was used to purchase my professional direction .
it is said that a number of academicians have a lot of complaints .
oh , by the way , i felt that some equipment imported was slaughtered .
in the united states , there is a testing system for measuring the air secret of the room , and it is widely believed that $ 500 has been captured , but the result is that it cost rmb 50,000 yuan !
in addition , many departments of the eastern university are now moving to the 9 th longhu new school district . however , the construction college is determined to stay behind . they say that it is necessary to give students a good architectural atmosphere , that the old school district can also see some classic buildings , and that the new school district has nothing .
oh , it seems that because all other parts of the system have moved away , the building institute will have another building .
so , president wang came straight to the point and told me that i could be assigned to an office alone in the future .
i was extremely embarrassed , and when president wang said about this , i felt nothing about it .
later , teacher zhang took me to tell me that it was not easy to say , because the office use was very tight , and some old professors did not have their own offices .
i am very uneasy about this , it seems that i do n't quite understand the national situation .
all in all , this trip to the eastern university was a very pleasant one , and i was impressed very well by the dedication and enthusiasm of the leaders of the college and related teachers .
i wish the college a smooth development and the construction college will continue to lead !
the qin huai river in the shadow of oars light
there has not been ever seen in the world .
two weeks ago , i dined with my colleagues and saw off my boss .
this boss may be called a female midfielder , who is very good for us under him , and we are willing to work for her , or even work overtime at night and weekend . this is not yet many americans , and she is also considered the best boss i have worked .
because she had to take care of her family and had more time to educate her children , she left the company and ran a mathematics tutorial class for primary school students and middle school students .
i believe she will succeed in whatever she does !
sun yan in africa presents love and concern , sand storms injured ( pictures )
care for children .
show " old mouse myoctanus " .
following the republic of the congo , sun yan twice followed the world outlook to visit niger in africa .
at a press conference held yesterday , she admitted that she was the most tired itinerary in history .
the local weather was hot , and drinking water was foul , and during their visit to the market , they were also angered by the people 's protest . even the camel 's seat was tied to the camel .
she was full of conditions and asked to cry in her heart several times : " i want to go home ! "
shocked by bad nutrition
during the three consecutive years of participation in the world expo , sun yan - chi claimed to be a senior spokesman .
she was carrying 30 bottles of vitamins , 40 hand - held electrodes and 500 candy bars to share with the children there .
she said that it was not enough to accumulate experience many times and not to control too many small gifts .
niger 's most serious problem is that her mother did not understand at all the question of upbringing and children were suffering from serious malnutrition .
sun yan went through a rare sandstorm in the country on her way from the capital of niger eight hours to the town of taswa , 500 kilometers away .
the wind and the sand also took advantage of the rain to bring about changes in the sky .
the jeep on board was even shaken by the wind .
looking back at that time , there was lingering fear in the car .
she began to dispel her suspicion only after she heard that sandstorms were a symbol of good luck and brought along rainwater for the land .
he was with the local residents .
sad mother , bringing up problems
at the sight of the arrival of the tower , local officials held a welcoming ceremony for the camel , asking the sun to sit on the camel to greet the local people .
however , the camel was scared by the flashing lights , and was completely out of control .
at the end of the lunar calendar , the sun jumped on her own but was not careful when she applied for the clothes to hurt her back and left with little blood marks of about eight centimeters .
during the visit , sun yan - chi visited four children suffering from severe malnutrition , and found that a four - month - old baby was 2.1 kilograms in weight , which was totally different from a person .
she said : " he is very sad and his situation is really exaggerated . however , it should also be a question of mom and should teach them a correct concept of nutrition . "
the key to china 's education is human flexibility
the key to china 's education lies in human nature
the purpose of education is to make it easier for the educated to live and enjoy in the existing social environment .
the " survival " is a very good understanding of everyone , and the " enjoyment " of everyone may be simply understood as " playing with pleasure . " in fact , this is not the case . the scope of " enjoyment " here is very wide .

2 . mental enhancement this reporter can have a clearer understanding of the society in which he belongs , learn how to deal with others , and acquire the skill to adapt to living and enjoy his experience .
the above expositions explain the purpose of education and are not very related to this article . now the emphasis is on education in china .
the essence of human nature is : fully understanding the differences between individual people cannot be regarded as equal .
club original : learning from buffett several stages
club original : learning from buffett several stages : i am taking a walk
1 ) phase i : when you first understand buffett , as if you got a treasure , you immediately applied it in practice , but at this time when you do n't have a thorough understanding of buffett 's philosophy , you often use a lot of wrong , indiscriminate use and blind use , so sometimes the effect is out of the question .
2 ) phase ii : " breakthrough " buffett , after a period of study and practice , almost every " smart person " is considering several issues , such as what should buffett with chinese characteristics do ?
should buffett 's theory be used flexibly in china ?
can it do better than buffett ?
therefore , during this stage , we mainly found buffett theory with chinese characteristics by considering itself as the right person and acting blindly .
after a period of practice , the results often become unsustainable from time to time . if the luck of transportation is good , it will be best to suffer some losses and turn back at an early date .
3 ) phase iii : after returning to buffett , we can finally understand that we are already an ordinary person and not a talented person .
their demands on themselves should be low , and learning from buffett is completely sufficient .
the simplest and most effective on the contrary is , but the simple method often contains very profound principles , which can only be carried through to the end in a better way after we have a thorough understanding of these principles .
the performance of this stage is that its short - term effects are not great , its long - term effects are numerous , and its effectiveness is sustained .
4 ) phase iv : buffett , after suffering from sustainable effects , basically is obstinate toward buffett 's theory during this stage . he completely ignored the non - buffett company .
it is necessary to continuously study and deepen our understanding of buffett and apply it in practice .
the time taken by each individual may not necessarily be related to his / her personal situation and the air .
sincerity towards buddha ( 2365 3903 ) 1405
he was an old online friend of mine who gave this story in the group .
i would rather write this story in this column .
it is hoped that everyone will be able to see this article and do not expect it to become the so - called cream , but some things , some truth , often come from a short story of being an intrepid .
this is a very cold story .
i really hope this is just a story . ... because my heart is really sad .
three female drivers on the mountain were actually staring at the beautiful female driver . they forced china and pakistan to stop . they wanted to take female drivers off to play games . female drivers shouted for help in a hurry . passengers of the car kept quiet out of fear .
one of the middle - aged and weak men rose up , but were injured on the ground .
despite the delay by the female driver , no one responded to the call .
at half a hour later , the three robbers returned with the female driver who was not properly dressed .
the driver of the woman driver was injured with bleeding and got off the car .
the man refused , but stubbornly stuck .
hello , do n't get off , my car will not pull you !
the middle - aged man became anxious and said : why are n't you talking about reason ? i want to save you ?
do you save me ?
what did you save me ?
the female driver flatly denied the allegation , which caused several passengers to laugh .
the middle - aged man was extremely angry and bitterly hated himself !
he could not save the person from this kind of expulsion result , and he was determined not to stop it .
he also said , i bought a ticket , and i have the right to ride a car !
the driver said mercilessly and mercilessly : i will not drive if i do not get off .
unexpectedly , however , just now , the crew members who had turned a blind eye to the atrocities committed by the vehicles were urged to pull out of the car with concerted efforts as soon as they had just warmed up : so long as you could not stop , we could not afford to delay !
several ambitious passengers even wanted to delay the middle - aged man from getting out of the car . this reminds people of what he said in the case of a " pole " under a pen to stop here .
the three scoundrels smiled and were proud of themselves .
among them , a black - lipped rogue said with no shame : my gospel has fooled her !
the other two scoundrels also spread nonsense : she is my target .
he was pushed away by a dispute and threw away the man 's luggage from the window .
the car ran steadily along the mountain path , where the female driver snatched away her hair and sounded the recorder .
the vehicle quickly reached the peak , and it would fall down the mountain if it crossed a roundabout route . on the left side of the vehicle was cleaving through the mountain . on the right side , it was a swaying cliff .
the car secretly accelerated , and the female driver 's face was very calm . holding tightly to the steering wheel , her eyes were flowing with tears of jing ying .
the scoundrel seemed to have realized what , saying : if we move slowly or slowly , what do we want to do in our tmd ?
the female driver did not speak , and the speed was getting faster and faster .
the scoundrels attempted to rush up the steering wheel , but the vehicles ran like an arrow hitting the cliff .
on the next day , local newspapers reported : a disaster occurred in the fuhu mountain area yesterday , in which one china and pakistan fell to the foot of the mountain .
none of the drivers and 13 passengers on board the vehicle survived .
middle - aged people rushing to get off the street cried in newspapers .
nobody knows what he cried , why he cried .
darkness of railway stations
after going on the train for several days , i found that the underground stations in all parts of the country were busy !
if you want to know what the stations in various localities need to pay attention to ,
i am changsha , let 's talk about the situation in changsha first , and everyone must pay attention to your visit to the changsha railway station !
1 . train tickets that are always difficult to buy : every time at the changsha railway station starts school after the big holiday or the cold summer vacation , the tickets cannot be bought , and then queue up early .
the answer i asked was that travel agents had decided to leave the tickets !
however , how much do you need to do if you place a bit of money in the yellow cow ?
2 . be careful with fake tickets : it is not necessarily true that the votes of maverick in hunan are not necessarily genuine . hunan 's shuangfeng and xinhua depend on fake certificates to become rich while the other relies on counterfeit silver coins and coins to make a fortune . therefore , the fake tickets are too childish !
excavators are the lowest level , and some fake tickets are called a real , and none of the crew is separated !
3 . who moved my money : store owners at railway stations buy things with care !
if you want to give us zero bill , ha , your currency is always short of a corner , so you have to buy a big bill .
however , after you buy a big counterfeit note , the shop owner must be unable to find a note in his hand and then withdraw it to you , and at this time you have to take back a big counterfeit note !
4 . magician looking for zero : it is a crime if not all the shop owners exchange your large bill . the risk is relatively great !
therefore , some shop owners who are " courageous " have no choice but to act as magician . obviously , it is right to see the number of pictures he has chosen , but wait for you to have the chance to get the number you have , ha ha , a few times .
5 . foreign wine everywhere : the teahouse at the railway station is not so much , but you will know when you enter .
the low - quality red wine that can sell it to davis love iii can sell it to you at the price . if you do n't want to go out , your mother will probably not be able to see you out .
6 . roses and guns : many video cameras around the railway station are very attractive to our beautiful men . so if you go in and look at them as honored guests who want to relax , you will immediately have a silver knife that you spend in a five - star hotel , otherwise you will not be able to take it lightly forever !
7 . ice and fire : if you speak changsha 's accent or are familiar with changsha , then you will never want to hit a taxi in front of the station , what kind of face the taxi driver looks like in june !
however , if you come to changsha for the first time , to be happy with you , even if you go to a five - minute walk , the driver will also enthusiastically bring you to view the scenery of the state - level key tourist cities , and you will also use the famous pak sha card of second - hand smoke and hear a lot of betel palms of local characteristics .
of course , you have to pay your own fares .
nanjing subway drivers urged to undergo psychological adjustment
key word : psychological adjustment
according to a xinhua news agency report , on the evening of 3 july , an explosion occurred at the nanjing subway in which a slew of people died .
according to this reporter 's description , " zhu zhengting , 22 , a young subway driver , encountered a nightmare . when i saw him yesterday , i seemed to have not yet turned his god from fear into a seat , sat straight to the air , and the expression in his eyes looked somewhat in a trance . "
obviously , the spirit of this young driver was greatly affected , and he badly needed to undergo a psychological restructuring , otherwise he would bring harm to his life .
do you still remember that more than 10 years ago , the rescue worker who rescued a girl from an abandoned oil well in durao , the united states finally chose to commit suicide after enduring long - term mental torment .
at that time , although he had a simple psychological adjustment , because people focused more attention on the rescued little girl , he ignored the people who needed more psychological adjustment and finally could not avoid the occurrence of tragedies .
similarly , a few years ago , the british policeman who opened a container in the dover strait was reportedly shocked at the scene .
it was only after more than two months of psychological adjustments by the british side that brought him back to normal .
people will suffer extremely great psychological harm after being stimulated by disasters . at this time , relying on personal strength alone will be very difficult to completely recover and often leave behind psychological wounds .
since it is hard for outsiders to discover this injury and find out that there is no way to do it , many of those involved will suffer all their lives .
however , it is not enough for the people of our country to show concern for psychological wounds . in particular , the families or departments in charge of the matter often think of it after losing the best period . it is already too late at that time .
after the media become diversified , we often hear about some hacker incidents that have harmed many female teenagers , and many young children have seen the cruel harm done to their parents .
after these young people were rescued , very few people heard that they had received psychological treatment , and more often than not , they were relieved by family love and comfort .
although the victims can feel that they are safe , the injury they have suffered has become a wound that can never be cured , and will be awakened at all times and affect the lives of the victims .
it is fortunate that the driver 's leadership immediately persuaded him and relieved him of his mental pressure .
after all , the responsibility for the accident is not with the driver , and the driver has taken measures when he found out the situation . what he should do is not stop the occurrence of the tragedy .
it is believed that even if they were not the drivers concerned , anyone at the scene would be intimidated by the accident .
however , other people have no responsibility to commit suicide , even though they have been intimidated , they will gradually be forgotten as time develops .
the drivers concerned are not so fortunate that they must remember that they will probably remember for a whole life .
if he can extricate himself from this state of mind , even if he can not extricate himself from life , he will often be subjected to such a shock and scare .
modern health concepts are more comprehensive than in the past , and mental health is beginning to attract people 's attention .
it is regrettable that the spiritual state of mankind is very disheartedness . especially in the cities , people 's mental health is extremely poor , and the majority of people have more or less hidden dangers in their minds . however , some people have encountered problems and have failed to pay sufficient attention to them .
just think of the lesson of the " yang lijuan incident " in the previous stage , some irresponsible media regarded a patient being tortured by mental problems as a target of speculation , which had a very bad social impact .
in the future , we should avoid such incidents from happening , otherwise our society will truly become a morbid society .
5 secondary 5 teachers ' training in new curriculum
the key words : teachers of secondary five ( s5 ) and secondary five ( s5 ) secondary five ( s5 ) of the new curriculum pui tung hau were moved to feel the pressure and motivation of the new curriculum from the morning of july 13 to 15 .
they also considered that the new curriculum reform was a rare opportunity and challenge to the development of education in schools .
on the morning of 13 november , a number of teachers and teachers from wukou and suining and other localities rushed to the city education bureau to block the cars due to the construction of the highway from dongkou to longgang . the education bureau staff who had already been on the truck will move out of the car and get training materials .
at 2 : 30 pm , teachers , braving the bitter winter , again went to the city 's no. 1 , city no. 2 , and city 's no. 6 multimedia classroom to listen to the experts ' lectures .
in the following two days , teachers may attend lectures or listen to the experiences and lessons of teachers who have entered the province for the new curriculum reform , and some of the teachers and teachers who have participated in the provincial new curriculum training have also introduced their experiences .
on the morning of the 15 th , after hearing all the training courses , they conducted an examination and successfully passed the examination and obtained a graduation certificate from the five teachers of the no. 5 secondary school at dongkou because they studied seriously and were not late to retire early .
during the training period , teachers of the five secondary schools from the east gate exchanged views with one another , and at the beginning they felt that the new curriculum was quite unfamiliar , with heavy tasks , great pressure , and difficult to grasp .
however , after the training , everyone felt that this was also an opportunity and a challenge .
they are determined to make efforts to readjust the knowledge structure and as far as possible fulfill the task of curriculum reform .
the second batch of teachers attending the new courses arrived at the relevant training places on 16 november .
the city education bureau plans to participate in the reform of the course by holding new training meetings
the key word : the secondary five school at tung hau pei convened a conference on new curriculum training .
at 1200 hours on 5 july , the school heads held a teacher meeting in the school room to attend a new training course for the summer vacation .
principal xie relayed the spirit of the new curriculum training meeting he participated in in in the county , expounded the significance of the new curriculum reform , and made specific arrangements for the personnel , time , costs , and attention items involved in the training .
it has been learned that the principal and instructor of the new curriculum reform meeting in shaoyang city and the teacher at the top one level in the next semester .
it is said that the money was appropriated by the xinhua bookstore .
the first is general knowledge training for principals and instructors , and the second is divided into three categories of training for teachers . the first stage ( language , chemistry , history , and biology ) is to report back to the hall on the first floor of the city education bureau on the morning of 13 july , and they must bring along their identity cards and collect relevant expenses .
afterwards , classes will be held every day at around 8 : 00 a.m . and 2 : 30 p.m .
by the morning of 15 july , the actual study time will be two days .
they must also pass examination and issue certificates to those who have passed the examination .
the history department taught at the shaoyang junior high school .
after returning , the school paid another 60 yuan in school fees and charges and refused to enjoy business travel subsidy .
be friends of music and star fans
key words : star fans
i have never met a female friend .
i told her directly , i appreciate you !
because you have directly expressed your love .
she likes a male who acted as a popular entertainment program in taiwan to host and never covered up such a feeling .
the male host presided over the program in jinan , where she flew to jinan , where the male host flew to changsha .
in the book hosted by the man , she said that a friend gave me a bullet - free shot . she told me with surprise , " i 'm giving it . "
she also participated in the work of an electronic journal for stars , and she chatted with me in every issue .
i always like to contact some people who are honest and so - and - so star fans .
these stars can be movie stars , they can be soccer stars , and of course they can be great men .
i never felt these friends were superficial , i think they were very lovely .
these people are usually people with true sexual feelings , like to like , not to like , to like .
it will be very easy to get in touch with such people .
although they will not think about your feelings , at least you know their joy and sorrow , and know that there will be greater sense of security when you come into contact with them .
these people were also very frank .
you should know that you have the courage to express your likes .
it is precisely because of this that many people quietly like a person throughout his whole life , or perhaps he will be somewhat unable to see anyone who brazenly says that he is someone 's fan .
to be honest , i think a person has the greatest advantage , to be frank and sincere toward his friends .
however , it is actually very difficult to achieve this .
being able to enjoy being a star also proves that he has an selfless character in his heart .
some of my friends are fans of stars .
at some times , in order to see this star on the one hand , they can endure hardships and sacrifice a lot , save their food and drink a lot , hold a paper card on their left , and shout on the right hand according to the camera and their mouth .
it can be said that they are very silly and naive , but they love a person regardless of reward .
this is because in reality , one thinks highly of one 's own self - love and one 's own belief that one does not approve of many others , so this selfless devotion is somewhat valuable .
therefore , when everyone chat about who the stars they like , if there is a saying , i will never worship others .
ha , that 's really careful .
zhang xiaohui
key word : zhang xiaohui
by chance , i saw that zhang xiaohui was playing the leading role of zhang xiaohui who had not come for a long time .
i imagined it would be the time to publicize " peach . "
seeing the " peach " was my date of addiction .
at that time i felt it was very unusual , as a color film could actually shoot such a beautiful scene , sometimes it was very interesting , it was called a scene of love .
actually , there are not many scenes of love , but they cover quite a few countries .
south korea and japan were the first to come into contact .
later , i saw quite a few films from third world countries as well as from latin america and europe . on the contrary , i seldom see films from hollywood and france .
two of my computers did not have to be deleted , one was " youth " and the other was " peach " .
in the first half of the " peach " was still very good . everyone was a newcomer . the performance was very effective . the director also had a standard .
in the second half of the year , i had a little changed my attitude and could not accept it at all .
i actually want to say that zhang xiaohui said in the program that her boyfriend covered almost all the countries of the world , except africa .
at present , she has four boyfriend .
ordinary people are afraid that they are unable to accept this question , and they will say that this person is unruly .
however , the crux of the problem lies in the fact that when she said these issues , she was very frank and without the slightest sense of sorrow .
she also talked about her own love outlook .
for example , the two sides need independence in their economies .
i guess my personality is independent , and i control my own destiny .
because i know love in love is alive and selfish , how can i allow my beloved one to accept others ' love at the same time .
according to my experience and conjectures , the love of zhang xiaohui is no longer simple , but she must be a typical sister relationship .
in love with the older sister , the older sister could accommodate all , including the younger brother , and at the same time the younger brother could depend on his older sister indefinitely because of the charm and mother nature of the other party , but probably he did not mind whether or not he was the only one .
however , in zhang xiaohui 's speech , i found that she was actually a person who knows how to enjoy life .
for example , she is fond of traveling to such a state of wild boastering .
so i have every reason to believe that her life is also very brilliant .
if before the change , i am afraid i still cannot accept this kind of phenomenon .
it can be compared to many people who have accepted it now , but actually it has nothing much to do with tolerance and tolerance , but because as long as i get close to my own roots , i do n't have absolute love or love .
these people include passers - by , friends b , zhang ziyi , good friends c , and sister lotus .
looking at other people 's lives , how can we see that they are the stars in their own life and for other people ?
it can be compared to that , although i am not in the political arena , my legend has always been there .
people must have some entertainment spirit
key word : entertainment spirit
people live a very tired thing , so they should still have a little entertainment spirit .
or visit some of the joke of others or talk about some other people 's gossip .
for example , i went to the " entertainment gossims " page of the earth and became relaxed a little bit .
people speak their minds freely , but of course you should have the ability to distinguish right from wrong , because all kinds of " black " things are constantly going on .
" if you want to say that , " you do n't know what you said , but you have to make clear what you are watching .
cai kangyong is called a " scholar . "
if i reckon it was a kind of book reading , but it was not yet thoroughly understood .
okay , i always know myself well .
however , while reading this book , i got some things i thought of .
coincidentally , i like to think of blind spots , so i think of things while reading , but there are many things in common , many of which are suddenly bright .
as a result , they gradually formed some habits , such as telling themselves to be tougher against themselves and better for others ;
when we encounter problems , we should first find out our own reasons .
they treat things rationally and treat friendship with a little bit .
we should keep ourselves low - key and keep our work low - key .
but you know , no one is so nice , always selfish , always taking into account his personal gains and losses , always being confused and confused as it should be when it is time to reason .
so fortunately , we will not think of regret over the choice we made .
if you do it , you will do it , and you will know how to plant it .
people think so many useless things .
okay , i am not that kind of person who likes to put on a board and raise my academic status , i am also a common person .
however , the difference between them and some people lies in the fact that they do not necessarily have to be angry and rational in everything .
or , for example , their own conviction is particularly strong .
once a person is trusted , well , i think everything of him is good .
even if they are inadequate , they are willing to accommodate them .
even though it is not the type of one calling for calling for friends , it is a kind of one that gives one the place to think for friends .
for this reason , however , the quality of our friends is relatively strict .
i do n't understand why there are so many people who trust the newspaper .
or , in their minds , the current reporting still has that kind of sacred spirit as before .
however , there are still more things in this world that i do n't understand .
joke .
he turned a deaf ear to himself .
song dandan 's " depth of happiness " is warm and moved .
key words : song dan is deep of happiness
a while ago , i read a new book about song dan in the newspaper , called " deep of happiness . "
i wanted to read it very much .
because i think as a woman reaching this age , she has such a kind of occupation , family and career changes , how does she view herself and life after all ?
as expected , i was disappointed . after seeing this , i felt two things : first , i was electrocuted and looked at other people 's life , and i could also see my shadow , and second , i was very moved and touched by some details of family ties .
why was it electrocuted ?
in the book , song dan wrote , " i neglect an important principle in my life : giving it greater happiness than accepting it .
i am always busy to give myself a happy life .
i do n't know , and i do n't understand , that i neglect giving others permission , that is , ignoring the fact that others get their happy rights . "
i found that i myself had been enjoying this kind of happiness , and maybe i should pay attention to it in the future .
if a person can calmly face his own past and display all this before everyone , it will require great courage .
this includes her initial love , her failed marriage with england , her deep dissection of herself , and her affection for her son .
this book also deserves praise , because as a publishing house , i think i was trying my best to advocate her focusing on the cases of " i love my home , " " ambush from 10 sides , " and a series of small products zhao benshan .
however , i think she must insist on what she says . zhao benshan was only talking about it in the end . he almost did not mention " ambush from 10 sides " and " i love my home . "
the book is permeated with an emotional and warm feeling of a 40 - year - old woman toward life , love , family , and family .
busy holidays
key word : busy during holidays
the holiday is almost a week away , and i have never been idle .
it held a meeting at the institute , and it is also necessary to prepare materials and the draft speech at the meeting to be held next week .
this holiday will be very busy .
if no unexpected events occur , according to the plan , three or five cities will meet .
all of a sudden , their lives were filled with content , the same type , and different types of things , almost forgetting what happened during the previous holidays .
it seems that i have not been idle all the time in my memory .
however , it originally had been quite long that i could control myself , but it seemed that this year i did not have much time left .
good things ? or bad things ?
busy , it will be somewhat substantiated , but if the busy schedule fails to yield any results , the significance of this busy schedule will be discounted .
at times , however , it seems that life cannot be counted entirely according to results , and life is used to slowly feel , and stability and happiness are also a kind of achievement , although such achievements are sometimes unable to be measured by the social appraisal standards .
everyone needs to identify social values and self - values . what if the two cannot be equal , what will we do ?
marxism taught us to take social values as the mainstay and advocate that individuals should make contributions to society , but in reality , a healthy and sound society should also fully respect individual aspirations and choice of value and create conditions for realizing individual values .
all of a sudden , i thought of this and found more and more effective marxist principles .
the reasoning is indeed this reasoning , but when people really reach the reality , they cannot avoid confusion sometimes .
even if the realization of self - values does not hamper social values , every individual in reality is satisfied with the realization of true self - satisfaction and has ignored social comments ?
or , can our satisfaction of self - value be divorced from social assessment ?
it seems very difficult .
therefore , while striving to be an ordinary person , we can hardly avoid pursuing extraordinary and overtaking , and if we wasted our lives , we will always bear our own responsibilities .
this is probably the aspect of human society .
it was a vacation , but it was still a bit easier .
at least , we can watch some video discs for a while and relax .
we can talk freely , but we still have to do our work , and we still have time to go by .
i will go to xi'an next week for a meeting .
even though i have never been there , i do n't seem to be a city that i like to see .
i hope this visit will change my impression of this city and shout .
" live a very women 's right "
key message : boys and girls age
in the afternoon , park called me , chatted for a while , and talked about the " happy man 's voice . "
ying ying said , " no ? you are so lovely . after watching a super girl , you are simply a loyal audience of hunan tv . "
i said yes .
park said that after seeing some boys ' selection shows , i feel that they are all women and men , but i also share the same feeling with her , but she said happy men have reached 5 to 4 , and next week they will be 4 to 3 , playing very well , a wonderful performance .
the study of the ying of popular culture and consumer culture also said with great excitement that we should also see next week . after all , at the most crucial stage of the competition , we must have a good look , pay attention to these , and accumulate case resources for future research .
then we talked about this is a male age .
men have finally changed from " observation person " to " being watched person " . in the past , women , being the guest , became the main body , so they could appreciate and face various kinds of men 's performances in this men 's sex era from the angle of observers .
yingyi said that this was the liberation of women , it was a symbol of women 's rights .
then she went on and said , " do n't you feel that you live a very women 's right now ? "
when i heard it , i was very happy to laugh .
this statement itself is full of women 's rights doctrine , and it is only because i have no ability to distinguish between good and bad , that i can explain these things more profoundly and clearly .
a very special quality sense , a kind of force that directly pointed at people 's hearts through time and space , is very comfortable to sing the song of happy man chen chusheng .
the soul - inspiring song is varied in form , full of emotion and elegant in appearance , but gives people the feeling of being relaxed and lively ;
zhang jie 's songs were loud and clear . in particular , his two songs , " your look , " and " the past and present , " are old songs that i like very much .
wei chen is a lovely and pure face like lu yi . it is said that the voice of a girl likes very well .
such a further rivalry between the four powers should be very good .
i look forward to their wonderful performance next week !
6 . mess of the bubble mood on 29 june
key message : sesame vegetables in seoul
6 . the mess of 29 june has opened up the international roaming . when the aircraft lands , the cell phone seems like a broken electrical signal . it is still not a single signal . perhaps , the sphere of influence of the world link is the target area and will take effect from the next toll day .
in these few days , i will have lost contact with everyone for a short time , ha ha , will anyone worry about me because of this ?
after opening up his secretary 's office , he only wanted to prove that he is concerned about me .
both public and private .
however , the question is , who is i hoping for ?
my heart , i do n't know when i started , and i got into a blank again .
do n't you understand why there are always some people who want to stay and some people who do not want to stay always think they can squeeze into the market ?
but in your heart , can " white gloves leave your position ? "
after all , material and heart cannot be discussed the same day !
our car is traveling at the high speed of busan .
the minister drove the car indecently , and i did not have much to say .
after all , he did not understand chinese and did not understand english , and i could only speak a few poor english words .
there is a rather silly look at the computer , hitting the keyboard , and in addition to the sound of the keyboard , that is , the happy gasim cruise of the rok miss , everything is too calm .
outside the window , there were only continuous green and grey days left .
silence is not very much like my personality .
to my surprise , this country was the only country that made me feel grateful in english .
apart from the radiant dizziness effect on me in the circle full of eyes , there is no other function in the circle .
i think south korea will certainly not go to produce smooth rules .
this is because there is no need for the market .
seoul is clean , thorough and careful .
unfortunately , apart from the location and department stores , the impression of staying in seoul in the next few days is only limited to the observation along the way .
fortunately , everything is still fine !
the koreans have a very traditional courtesy , a pair of eyes , and a serious listening smile .
everything we can pay attention to is a beautiful appearance , a traditional customs , an ancient architectural style , and a progressive civilization that is closely related to combat readiness .
is this hypocritical ?
it is still hypocritical , and at least everyone is in etiquette !
if ugly things are not seen , maybe they will think they are gone .
korean food and drink are excellent !
it is only that i do n't like , do n't understand why they come and go , but just take various kinds of foam , and grapple , of course , they will not be able to swim with the sea .
changing their concepts , people in korea are still very harsh in their studies of eating . they can also distinguish the differences in the surface or the ground , the duration , and the accuracy of preserved vegetables from that of the ground .
from another angle , this shows that the strict attitude of the korean people is probably related to cooking from an early morning to the evening .
the only thing is that the minister is taking the japanese bean tofu strips , which we are going to take with us soon , how are they integrated with cooking ?
it reminds chinese restaurant managers of the feeling that they wanted to cry last night , that the only one that could import was bubble vegetables .
ah , thank you , china southern airlines , for the pickle vegetables they contributed together in providing aircraft meals .
the airline must think that i 'm going to get used to it from the moment i got aboard .
you have to return home in two days , if there is no one to miss it , do you still miss the auntie to make a piece of pork !
after all , stomach satisfaction is more direct than heart .
of course , this has nothing to do with cooking .
two trees
two trees , one was me , one was my sister .
we are cool to each other and care for each other .
i have many children in this generation , but i have only my sister and brother , so my sister 's arrival here seems extremely important .
we are all bitter kids . we are very small and we have to take part in a lot of domestic work . although i have always worked hard to become a big man , i have always wanted to work as an expert , but i have never received my father 's consent .
when i was small , i had a dreamlike habit , but it was not very serious , but it would be difficult for me to avoid doing household chores .
for example , my father let me wipe out a little mud from the chime i gave to old houses , and i climbed up the roof to operate .
the chimney flue , but when the rain was raining , the house revealed water , because i smashed the room .
for example , my father was given a light bulb , that kind of old - type light bulbs .
when i climbed onto the stools , the bulbs in my hand fell to the concrete floor and smashed .
examples like this can not be compared to the one mentioned above , so when a sister went to the scene and went into the house , these toasts are naturally contracted by him , and they do very well and do not need to pay any labor costs .
i could n't escape to read books that looked like brick and brick in the corner .
later we became two trees , two big trees sufficient to support a family .
his father , however , declined to an inevitable degree . sitting in a wheelchair , he became an unheard - of shrubs in the shade .
as to who 's expected , the 50 - year - old sister suddenly became infected with serious illness , and the big tree , which appears to be luxuriant and green , is unexpectedly unable to find anything to believe or come close to that fear of death .
in that summer , the doctor casually said , " there is no value of the operation outside the operation room of the hospital . "
it can live for up to two months .
at that moment i was suddenly hit by a bullet , my soul instantly broke out , and a foolish man panicked there .
i started to dream of traveling again , and saw the old courtyard of my home and the busy scenes of my young sister - in - law in the courtyard .
my sister 's weeping cry awed me . i hurriedly rushed to embrace my older sister who was sitting down on the hospital corridor , and we were all tears rolling around .
suddenly the bright and unbroken sun disappeared , and my eyes became black one after another .
after returning from beijing to our city , the older sister learned about her condition very soon . after crying with her older sister , he felt relieved .
when the older sister started to arrange for her son in an orderly manner after her death , for instance , she told her son : i will take good care of your grandmother , the old woman will have to open up the cemetery with your grandpa and your bones after her death , and the tomb will open up at the same time .
i often go to visit your basking god and catch up with the new year to buy some practical items for him .
for example , he told my younger sister : after i left , you should often see your sister , she must be very lonely .
i tried my best to visit him and face me , but he looked ashamed and ashamed .
we are always impolite , just like two plants that have life but cannot hold dialogue .
are these two adult trees that have enabled us to calmly face up to the hardships , and what are we going to explain ?
it seemed that there was no need .
because you know in your heart : after you left , your older sister , your older sister , and your children , as well as everyone , can only rely on my wukesar to support you on your own .
who called me a man ?
it 's a man , no matter whether you want it or not , you have to hold your spine up without hesitation , take responsibility .
the only regret is : why did your wukesar withered long ago , and you should have a rich and colorful age ?
the day you left was the first day of the lunar new year .
that is when chinese people all over the world greet the spring festival happily , you are alone .
perhaps , in another space and space , another child of life will sprout a new life ?
my life 's n - minute
the reason why there is such a seemingly fashionable headline is that at this moment of extreme disappointment , the confused brain is simply unable to attend to time .
if a innocent person receives the death sentence in the air , will he still be critical of the language law in the judgment ?
that was a winter day , and it was very cold in the youth 's point .
i do n't know who is duty - bound , and the stove was not hot for a day .
it is said that when a strong earthquake occurs in the evening , we will be lazy when we come back to our house .
on the long store where we could sleep for 12 individuals , four of us were wrapped with cotton . we played " three shots " and " one shot and one meal " amid a collapsed light .
suddenly , a loud and close voice came , and several of us looked at the moment and immediately realized the arrival of the disaster .
as a result , he turned a blind eye to the paper plate in his hand and flew down to the ground , crossing two narrow housing doors , backing out .
just in the twinkling of an eye when we ran out of the dormitory , the poor mao - house , which was built with stones , was crushed into pieces in an instant .
as if we were standing in the courtyard , standing on a rock - shaking boat , we would not be able to keep ourselves fixed , just as if we had not come to the end .
in these few seconds , the previous stable image of all the buildings on our side has given us the strange call of " being dumbfounded " one after another , jumping off almost crazy pincer , and then turning it into a smokescreen .
of course , the electric wires on the head were unwilling to be lonely , and the " gallows " jumped up and the firecrackers ran away like a four - inch object .
behind us , the earthquake demons who wreaked havoc on ourselves are releasing the gift of celebration in their creativity , and the earth of five light and ten color can be compared with the large - scale dance of any war , sound sound drum , torturing every weak nerve .
at that time , there was only one thought : the doomsday had arrived !
i can imagine that the leash underneath the feet ran out and the boiling rock , like steel water , made a intense invitation that human beings plunged into the rocks one after another like a termites without even a piece of green smoke .
my spine is numb wood , which is as fast as getting ice and water .
i think that mankind is bidding farewell to this colorful world , will the history of civilization of tens of thousands of years disappear from the scene ?
but i am not even 20 years old , the youthful flower has just begun to bloom , the joy of my survival has just come to my senses , how can i leave my love for a beautiful life !
where are your parents and relatives , what are you doing now , are you still living in the world ?
how much do i think of you in the face of the moment of death and death smiling !
nie : i have no idea how long it has been and how poor i have finally found out : the sound of the earth is weakening to a little extent , the earth 's shock is slowing down , and the fireworks on the head are not glittering .
a huge ship sailing slowly into a tranquil harbor under rough seas .
a young and easy - to - break heart was finally thrown back into its original position after suffering close madness .
the earth , my home , you finally let us feel the warmth and warmth of the family !
a fortunate feeling of robbing later generations slowly filled the whole body with warm currents from the feet .
after doughty , just 17 years old , faced with the once harmonious and warm youth center , now it is a ruins of the ruins of the ruins of the ruins , suddenly cried out .
all of them were infected , with tears in their eyes .
has the sky begun to fall snow for the misfortune of mankind ?
that year , the sea city earthquake claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people .
an expert said : fortunately , the forecast was timely , and when people are still sleeping , a strong earthquake at the level of " seven reporter three " will take at least 100,000 people 's lives !
just one year later , the tangshan earthquake hit china , killing more than 200,000 people .
those things in the village
there are many families in the village . among them , the family members in southern china were the most suspect . there is a well - known saying in the village : fire prevention , anti - theft , and anti - southern defense .
the south african family is in fact quite honest .
some people usually steal watermelon and other things from others , and south 's family just stole a chicken and touched a dog in order not to isolate the whole village from the south .
everyone was not clean , who was the family of mine in southern yugoslavia ?
the family of the south has begun some dignified activities , showing that this village was the earliest built up of the ancestors of the south family . the family of the south has always been a major grain producer and has had some well - known people in history , and has made important contributions to the construction of the village .
at the same time , the family of the south invited village cadres to come home to take a look and sit there .
in short , the south family is very energetic , and it is necessary to fight active battles and seek strength .
not long ago , the western family did a very shameful thing and brutally persecuted the seedlings of the children of the southern family .
the house called xixi was famous for being a catalyst , and the young man in the village benefited from his family .
if you were not a good medium for the western family , how could you all get the good production !
however , at this time , the family members of the west went so far as to budge the seedlings of the south korean family in a place called hongdong . this is extremely evil . the whole village is filled with indignation , and one after another they claim that there is no good man in the west .
the family members of the south african people 's appeal to their families has aroused the sympathy of the entire village .
all of the village people took their mouth and water to their families .
thus , the battlefield moved to the west .
the south african family is determined to create a good image before the 17 th meeting of the village so that this person can flourish .
although the cadres in the village have been urging everyone to live in harmony everyday , this village is not tranquil at all .
what is most disgusting is that in a short span of two to three months , even pigs have also started to make trouble in a clamor to raise their value !
two years ago , every village got a cold , did n't they kill ?
why do n't you have a long mind ?
you argue with the revolution again , you cannot help but be killed !
although the life of the beautiful village and the british village , which are used to bully people , is rich , they are not necessarily peaceful .
there are so many vagrants that today , the tall buildings of the american village have been knocked down , and tomorrow some small cans are thrown into the subway to the british village , are n't they enough to scare people ?
therefore , people in the upper and middle villages generally felt that they could not live in a room , could not see any illness , and could not read books , but could easily grow some fields of crops , do some work , and engage in relations - related work . this could also be considered as entering a new era .
the family of the south , the family of the west , ah , who did not have any hard to read buddhist scriptures ?
let 's take the family members of the wan chai family , who is living in a small winding street in the southeast of the village , to say , although the parents of that family were not in good spirits , would our great zhongtong village still cover up this family ?
seeing that the 2008 village games will be held in our zhong village , those broken events in the village will be the province , the bad kids in the village will be the whole .
each household has its own family , its life lamps lit , it has the money to pay , it 's a strong effort .
when the time comes , everyone will go to the village to see the bird 's eggs come down from the bird 's nest !
( voice from outside : gold eggs or silver eggs , dear viewers , dear viewers , and myself as the host of village television stations . )

there is no screen , and the map of a large cell phone projector revealed
key word : cell phone
south korean company coliseum introduced a laser disc with only the size of coins .
since the modular piece is very small , you can even embedded this projection module on the cell phone , you can see on the wall a seven - inch projection area .
( viii ) the traditional projection instrument contains three different icd panels , each responsible for exporting the three different types of video signals of red , green , and blue . this type of small - scale projection device can change three colors by only using a single single receipt . this will reduce the size and manufacturing cost of the projection instrument .
